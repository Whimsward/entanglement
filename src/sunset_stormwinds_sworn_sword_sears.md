[Walking helps. It's a quiet trek brushing through the long grasses, occasionally tripping on a stone without the accompanied ache of stubbed toe. For a while David pushes aside his questions. He tries to take in the world around him instead.]

On the long walk to reach something like shelter, it’s the quiet that hits David hardest. He expects it, based on  everything he’s read about how much more background noise there is to the modern world even in the rural parts, but the moment he has acclimated to the distant thunder of the storm over the ocean and he and Mustang aren’t exchanging questions and answers, the gentle expanse of plains-grass under open sky unlatches a part of him like a suitcase and lets the tangled, bunched-up fabric crammed inside slowly bust free of its containment. He isn’t prepared for it. He’s too stunned to cry but it feels like he should and that dissonance makes its own little whirlpool. That whirlpool spirals around the line bolted to his center that continues drawing him, like Mustang’s back, towards the storm and the ocean. But in all of it, he breathes deep, and when he exhales it feels like he grows a little more back into shape.

Is there a different quality to the air here? Something strange about the way the air hangs or sighs around him? Is there anything alien about this grass, that during this stretch or the other rises above his head? If there is, he's not catching it. The alien from his world, the endlessly repeating monoliths bearing power lines and the painted asphalt roads, has no analogue that he can see here. Aside from the courtyard they'd emerged onto at first, there's no trace of what might have been a civilization here.

"Where did the roads go?"

Mustang glances back at him. At first he'd kept David in front of him, still protective, but after what David guessed (and tried to track with the stopwatch app on his phone but forgot about) was an hour, Mustang drifted ahead to more easily guide the way. He asks what David means about the roads.

David says, "If that Gate was important to transit for this area, wouldn't there be roads between it and nearby settlements? Especially the big ones."

"Overgrown," Mustang guesses. "The centuries work quickly."

"But not on the stones of that courtyard."

"Apparently not."

"So roads are not so magic here, I guess." He adds it to his notes.

"'Magic' in what sense?" Mustang asks back. "Paradigmatic consequence?"

"Uh…" David stumbles over another hidden stone. "So this might be a weird question, but what language are we speaking right now?"

"We call it 'midspeech' in Ea'river. Kolomaer names it as the Trade-tongue."

"So, the go-between language for this part of the world."

"Yes."

"And you understand everything I say?"

"The words, yes. Your intent is not always clear. But that is how language functions, yes? Everything is mutually understood, except sometimes meanings that are hidden to the speaker, the listener, or both."

"That's not how it works,” David says. He counts his words after the fact, when Mustang whirls around and gives him a scowl. David swallows. It's a hard face this man has, worn smooth of many of its readable expressions. The one on Mustang’s face now would normally push David into a panic, scrambling for something to say that can scrub over whatever social error he must have just made and keep himself afloat. But something about the way Mustang has acted protectively so far, and what Mustang has said about the magic that seems to shield David from harm, gives him space to breathe and read that expression deeper.

It is not a scowl. It's Mustang trying to read David, finding him somehow mutually inscrutable.

Mustang says, "You did that by accident."

David finds his footing again, "If you run into someone from the other side of the world, they're going to be from a group of people with a different history than yours. They're not going to even use the same mouth sounds to mean the same things. Probably won't even have the same grammar. Maybe it won't be five words for them. Or that's how it works where I'm from."

"I had not thought to learn about Veneth from a visitor. But you are right, I can read it now. Here on Veneth, the meaning of our words is conveyed directly."

"So I could be speaking English to you right now," David says. "My language, and it might as well be the same, because magic."

"You asked about this because I was uncertain what you meant by 'magic.' This seems to be a difficult meaning for Veneth's Association to align, because that word as I hear it means somehow tricking or cheating the world, or our understanding of it, to make something you want happen that might be unexpected. But the Paradigms, and alignment with them, are not a way to exploit a gap in the rules. They're ways to understand our world, and how it flows.

"I feel my husband could better explain it…"

"Magic doesn't exist on Earth," David says. "It's an idea people have. 'What if the world worked this way instead?' What if that weird old lady who lives out in the woods because we don't like how she looks and smells cursed our fields and that's why the harvest was bad?

"So when we figure something out on Earth that helps us, some quirk about the way the world works, we call it science. We give it different language. But it doesn't work like your Paradigm stuff, your swords that carve doors to other realities and your universal translator-planet. It's stuff we make using careful application of what we've learned using very precise tools on very specific materials, like my phone. It takes an enormous amount of work, of cleverness, and, usually, forcing people to sacrifice themselves for the product.

"The kinds of things you can do are the things we'd call magic, there."

“Then perhaps we can hope that Thrast is stifled in your realm, if it is so hostile to the flow of Veneth.”

“Is it?” David asks. “I’m here.”

Mustang said, "Hrm."

"Do you know what was up with my earbuds being a chunk of amber for a hot second?"

Pause. "I thought I was mistaken."
