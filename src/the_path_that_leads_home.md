| Flashback       |

Jenna Adamson leans against her kitchen counter, a phone pressed against her ear. There’s a broad, arched window in front of the sink with a full view of the back yard. Jenna watches her son recline in his hammock, strung up for the day between two maples that have been straining for dominance of the back yard for forty years. David is devouring another fantasy novel, some tale of daring feats and the conspiracy of fate, but at least he’s doing it while soaking up the first hours of real sunlight for the year. It’s unseasonably warm, but you don’t look a gift horse in the mouth like that.

The phone is ringing. It will ring five times, then go to voicemail. Jenna has already tried to call twice in the last few minutes. She wants to hear her daughter’s voice, yes even if it’s still raw with accusation, because it is her daughter’s voice. The phone rings five times, but those rings seem to stretch out towards the edge of the known universe. It’s long enough for Jenna to stare at one of her children and think of the other and feel the blossom of her love for them soak in the rays of hope that they will be happy. It’s long enough for the stretching to make her think of Lila staring at the night sky’s countless beckoning stars with her father, expounding for another hour on the sheer incredible scale of all that there is, its unknowable but nearly measured distance. It’s long enough she can mentally recite what she’s going to say if Lila picks up. It’s long enough she imagines, without really wanting to, rebuilding the bridge between herself and her daughter.

It’s long enough that, unlike with the last two tries, Jenna is too absorbed in thought to hang up once the call does go to voicemail. She says, “I wish you didn’t leave.” Then, startled, she hangs up.

Lila sits in the theater for a while after the movie ends. She appreciates the credits, and the space they give her to dry her eyes and collect herself. After, as she strides out into the warm, quiet light of the theater hall and turns off airplane mode she sees she has a voicemail from her mother. It’s three seconds long. She sees the auto-transcript as she’s deleting it. It feels like a javelin that comes thrumming through the empty space between her arm and her heart. Lila straightens her spine and heads back to her apartment.

Every Friday night, Kyle Adamson sits on their porch-swing and rocks himself. He stares up at the sky. For the first couple months, it’s very cloudy and he can’t see the stars. Eventually, though, he gathers their twinkling lights into his heart. Every Friday night, he calls Lila.

She doesn’t answer him, but that doesn’t stop him from leaving messages. He says he misses his little girl, that they all miss her. He tells her about what’s been going on in their lives. He tells her he trusts her. He knows she’s got to get her own life in order if she’s going to run the whole show some day. 	And he says he’s proud.

A part of Lila reaches back out to him, but she can’t call him back. Not yet. Not until she gets it sorted out, like he says.

Any sort of dog that has shepherd in its pedigree, like Spark, needs an outlet for its energy. Thankfully, Sandra likes to walk her dog. She enjoys the variation in the weather, though it has been a little hot in the summers the last couple years. She clings to the adage that in Michigan, “if you don’t like the weather just wait five minutes.” She doesn’t put much more thought into it than that. The rainy spring day with an umbrella, some baggies, and a leash on a city sidewalk suits Sandra just fine. She smiles and says hello to folks on her way.

Then a girl about her age comes up the sidewalk. She’s talking as fast as she’s walking, her eyes glazed over while she plies whoever it is on the other line with what sounds like answers to job interview questions. Sandra plans to mind her own business, get off to the side with her dog and continue on her day. But Spark doesn’t like the look of the girl’s scarf, or the way she smells, or something, because he strains against his leash and starts barking his head off. Sandra calls Spark to heel, but he’s not very well trained and won’t hear her over the sound of his defensive reaction to the lady on her phone.

“God.” Phone-girl sneers into her phone. She stops, then picks her way around past the radius of Spark’s leash. She says, “No, sorry, someone’s dog’s just going feral on the sidewalk.”

“Excuse me what,” Sandra says. 

Phone-girl rolls her eyes and keeps walking and talking.

Sandra calls out, “Don’t talk about my dog like that!” She kneels down by Spark’s head and nuzzles him. Scritches behind the ears. There’s a good boy. Forget that rich girl. Yeah, you’re such a good boy Sparky.

Lila, disappearing around the corner, still fixated on landing this position, feels a stab of shame. It gets tangled in a knot of memory, a room at the Vet and a brother in tears at home, and she shoves that all in a box for Future Lila to deal with later.

She gets an in-person interview. She doesn’t get the job.

Mark sits on a couch. It’s Lila’s couch; the one she picked out to go in the living room of their house—this house he bought and fixed up for them. Had fixed up, he corrects himself. Sure, he did a little of the demolition, and made the aesthetic calls, and paid for it, but it was the contractors who did the work that gave this place its value. It aches to practice that mindfulness, because it reminds him that she taught him the perspective, to think about where his money came from and where it was going and how his procession through life affected the people surrounding him. Lila taught him to practice being kind and doing good with what he had. The ache deepens: she taught him so much like that, then she cut herself loose from everyone.

The walls are a pleasant and abiding green in the living room they were going to share. The matte, brownish gray of the couch contributes toward the cozy earthen atmosphere they wanted. There’s other rooms in this house that are already painted, but not furnished. The upstairs is like a blank slate. The planning itself was unfinished. It was a recent obsession that led to Mark pushing everything up to the point they’d gotten to with their planning before she broke it off.

Mark sits in the dark except for the light of his phone. He keeps thinking maybe he should call her and then keeps not trying. She doesn’t have him blocked. She just won’t answer.

He should probably finish the house. Make his own choices about the rest of the rooms, maybe erase the parts she planned, and actually live here. Or he should sell it, or give it away. Make a halfway house, or something. That’s what she would tell him to do, if she found out he’d been sitting on empty, perfectly good housing for months. Maybe she’d even tell him to rent it out. That’s what his dad would assume he’d do with the property: make some income off of it.

Mark doesn’t need more income.

Is this why she left him? Is he too indecisive, too inactive? He doesn’t do enough, fast enough, to improve the lives of the communities around him? Or is it because in her eyes it will never be enough to wash away the taint of the exploitation that extracted his father’s many millions?

For the first time in six months, he gets a call. It’s her. He picks up immediately.

“Hey,” he says. He has to choke down calling her “love.” “What’s up?”

“I’m coming back to see my family,” Lila says. Her voice is sharp.

“That’s great, Li!”

“I don’t want to see you there.”

Mark says, “Okay. You won’t.”

“David says you still hang around. Making nice.” An accusation.

Mark’s free hand rubs the fabric of the empty couch seat next to him. He yearns for her to be beside him, where he can face her and soak her presence up like sunlight. He says, “I still like your family, Li.”

“Are you gonna give me the same shit about David needing a man in his life?”

“I am not your mother.”

The sound of Lila taking a deep breath. “Look, I… maybe I was stupid. I need to talk to Mom and Dad and I don’t need you as a distraction.”

“Li,” Mark says, “I already said I won’t be there. When are you coming?”

“Not sure yet.”

“And hey, you didn’t tell me being with your family was off limits. I would have respected that, if that was what you wanted.”

Lila practically growls into the phone. “You know what she’s like.”

“She’s not like that all the time,” Mark says. “And maybe my being there has helped her understand a bit. Where we come from.”

“Never mind,” Lila says. “I don’t want to talk about her.”

A long pause. She doesn’t hang up right away.

Mark asks, “How’ve you been doing? David says you don’t tell him much.”

“What’s there to tell him? That there’s no jobs out there? I’ve got some applications lined up for some programs, but…”

“Still can’t decide if you want to crunch the numbers or pour out the words?”

“We already had that talk. I can’t afford to do both. There’s not enough of me to go around.”

“Context was different then,” Mark says. “Because it seemed like, Before, you were okay with my solution. I can afford it for you.”

“Yeah but you can’t afford a cloning machine, can you?”

“I’m still trying to wrap my head around this, Li. There’s not enough of you to go around, so you shut everyone out and try harder to do it all yourself?”

Another pause. “Why do you think I’m going home? What the hell do I think I’m doing, Mark?”

“You’re trying,” he says without hesitation. “We’re all trying.”

“Yeah,” Lila says, trailing off.

“Am I going to have to wait another six months for you to call me again? Even as a friend?”

“I don’t know,” she says. “I hope not.”

David is already cleaning when his sister calls. His earbuds are in, pulsing music directly into his ears from a station that fits his mood. He’s got the trash can pulled out from its corner while he sweeps. After that it’ll be the wet work. He feels like he needs both things: the music internalizes what he’s feeling; the work externalizes what he wants. Doesn’t matter how long that cobweb’s been left standing in the corner between the toilet and the brush in its stand. A swish timed with a dark cymbal crash, and it’s gone now.
The music is cut off mid-riff by Lila’s ringtone, the opening of a different song where a solo flute plays a fore-ghost of the song’s melody low in its register. David snatches his phone up out of his pocket and answers before the drums break in.

“Hey, Li,” he says. 

“Hey,” she says. Once it’s clear the call is solid, he drops his phone back into his pocket. She’s in his ear.

“In the middle of cleaning,” David says. “Sorry if the sound’s a little off.” He finishes sweeping and sets the broom aside. Time to break out the chemicals. He heads to the cabinet.

Lila says, “How are you doing?” Then, having detected something in her own tone, adjusts her affect to mock the overearnestness of the first question. “Have you had any water today?”

As he grabs some cleaner and the sponge for the sink, David makes a face at the rest of the supplies. “I’ve had plenty.”

There’s a light, nervous chuckle on the other end of the call. “Sorry.”

David asks, “To what do I owe the pleasure of your call, dear sister?” He flicks the water on long enough to wet his sponge, then pours some soap onto it.

She says, a little off-beat, “Just wanted to talk.”

He scrubs around the drain stopper. “So is that hesitation I hear more sororal concern for my well being or is there something else that’s up?”

She pauses again. David spreads suds on the stainless steel faucet head. He spreads them onto the handles. It’s silent except for breathing and scrubbing. He briefly resents the absence of his music.

Finally, Lila says, “I think I might be coming home for a day or two.”

David turns the water on full blast. He wets the sponge enough that there’s hardly soap left in it, then uses it to rinse the faucet. He dips his finger into the stream, making the water split around it. It’s not hot right away. 

He says, “Mom and Dad aren’t here this weekend. Marriage retreat.”

“Oh,” she says.

“Probably good timing. We could make some popcorn and binge a season of something?” Water’s still cold. What is it about the upstairs faucets in this house that makes them take so long to heat up?

“I… wanted to talk to them.”

David squeezes the water out of the sponge and sets it next to the sink to dry. He steps back over to the open cabinet and pulls out the toilet bowl cleaner.

“That’s a surprise.” After it comes out of his mouth it feels like a lie. He’d felt the pinch building up in his chest before she called. No, couldn’t be that. Why would he dread getting to see his sister again? He twists the cap on the toilet bowl cleaner and douses the bowl. Has to be something else. 

“Just like me leaving?” she asks. 

David’s hand closes on the handle of the toilet brush. Her leaving hadn’t been a surprise. It had been a dam breaking, and it had broken around David’s fingers while he tried to plug the holes.

She’s trying to be conciliatory, using the same self-critical affect as when she asked if he’d been hydrating. It’s a tone like she knows she’s voicing something that could just go unspoken between them, but she is trying to express instead her openness to his honest assessment. Trying to (gently) goad him into blaming her for leaving, if he does. For his sake? For hers? As a practice run for their parents?

He asks, “Are you sure you’re ready?”


“Does it matter?”

Something about those words makes it push in tighter. Is it frustration that his sister can’t seem to go about conflict the quiet way? It’s always loudly in your face or loudly slamming the door on the way out. Is it worry over how Mom and Lila might approach the chance for a reconciliation like a pair of freight trains headed for a collision? Those things bother him, sure, but he’s never felt the pressure this intensely before. Like he’s waiting to be struck.

This particular chemical is supposed to sit in the toilet for a few minutes to soften things up before you get to scrubbing. David sets right in without waiting. It’s that or let the cinching curl his knees and arms against his chest and roll him across the bathroom floor.

“Hey,” Lila says after another pause. She’s quiet. Is he breathing too hard? “You okay?”

“I’m fine,” he lies, then corrects to: “I’ll be fine. Doesn’t usually…” Another sensation rises, a tingling that starts at the base of his neck and spreads goosebumps across his skin. This one, he knows the source of. Don’t notice me. Don’t worry about me. Don’t waste your time on me. I’m fine. I’m…

“David, I’m sorry. I--”

“It’s not you.” David huffs out a breath (not a sob, not yet), scrubs under the rim, and changes the subject. “Do you still want to come home this weekend, or are you waiting for Mom and Dad to be back?”

“Hold on,” Lila says. “If it’s not me then what is it? Please, I want you to be able to talk to me.”

David stands up. The toilet brush drips into the toilet. “It’s stupid. It’s nothing.”

Then anticipation of what’s coming breaks into the panic of it happening. His soul gives? The source of the pressure drives like a spike into some load-bearing pillar of his selfhood, and the line connected to it pulls taut. It happens in an instant, happens so suddenly and completely it almost feels like it’s always been there.

David somehow has time, even as the bolt of that transgression strikes, to cling to the thought that Lila has something to say to him. He wants--No. He insists on hearing what she says. So it is that a young man’s panicked assertion siphons some of the paradigmatic flow of reality as it shunts him across realms. When he appears out of context amid the flames of a smoldering study, his phone call with Lila Adamson does not end.

In his ear, his sister says, “You’re not nothing, David Adamson.”

---

Lila makes the call from her car after getting back from the store. The car is parked but still running to keep her cool. She sits in relative stillness while her brother occupies his hands, listening to his growing anxiety with her own deepening concern.

She knows that he doesn’t want her to notice, even castigates herself for worrying over him like their mother does, constantly fretting that he’s not coping well and at the same time never countenancing the idea that maybe David should get some help. Because, of course, why would he need it? He’s so productive, he graduated in the top ten of his high school, and he never complains. He’s an upper middle class white kid. He’s fine. He just has to figure himself out. But what if figuring himself out looks anything like how Lila has been figuring herself out?

She decides, mid-call, that she would rather try to help David somehow than have the call be about her. He doesn’t want to open up. He belittles himself. And she tells him that he’s not nothing.

At first Lila thinks that the tenuous connection she feels, tethering them across what she thinks is 50 miles, is just her love for her brother. It makes her feel like maybe he’ll hear her assert his value, and how much she means it, but the response that she gets sounds more like a gust of wind. Then a grunt, and a crackle as an earbud falls out of his ear and lands on stone.

“David?” she asks. She sits forward in her seat, cranking the AC down to nothing so the fans don’t interfere with what she can hear.

There are mumbled, incoherent questions that come in David’s voice from the other line, then more static.

A distant voice says, “Who are you?” There is something about the voice, and not just that it’s a stranger’s, that unsettles her. It’s a man’s voice, sonorant, but with nothing of the tenor that Mark or her Dad’s voice carries. And there is that something else, some strange slipknot of meaning tied around the words. The voice, closer now, continues, “What is this?”

Lila says, “David! What’s happening?”

His answer is garbled and sounds almost like choking.

She puts her phone on speaker and mounts it. She throws the car in reverse and all but peels out in the parking lot. It’s a little less than an hour’s drive to their parents’ house if she goes the speed limit. She’ll get there in twenty five minutes.
