# Faced with Doubt, Finality Blinks

|-----|

If the Bridge were an actual physical object in a place where physicality was properly embodied and expressed to the mind by ordinary means, then the Bridge’s relationship to the Sword would need to be communicated with details that can be grasped, like the apparent relative ages of the stone and the steel and a webbing of cracks that communicate the effects of the passage of time on both. But while this realm is old and the Sword is older still, there is no sign of weathering. The Sword’s apparent position in the Bridge is only a signpost of the effect the Sword has had on the Bridge. The Sword is not even bound to this realm.

David will process this later. Right now he can’t see past the spectacle of the Sword, though he can almost see a figure of light, posed like it’s holding the sword in place. The figure’s attention arrests him on sight. That central tether strains against David’s imagined mass. The last outward thing he notices is Mustang clapping his second hand on David’s other shoulder like he’s trying to keep David from losing his balance. Maybe he is.

***“Who approaches me?”*** An odd stray thought passes through David’s mind on encountering the angel’s voice: why would someone with a voice so imperious, so commanding, resort to the vulnerability of asking a question?

Then when Mere and Mustang are conspicuously, agonizingly silent, David feels put on the spot. When he tries to look to them, he can’t make out their faces in the glare of the angel’s light and the flames of the Sword.

He answers, *“It’s David.”*

***“Why has David Huxley Adamson come to stand before my vigil?”***

Mere'd *just* told him that they’d arrive when the thought that carried them here was completed. She also said…

*“We’re here to talk to Lenn,”* David says. It’s his best guess, but the angel doesn’t seem to accept the answer.

The angel leans forward, faceless gaze weighing David.

Having taken its measurements, the angel asks, ***“Do you know what waits beyond my vigil?”***

David makes a fidgety gesture at the giant sword that’s on fire and emanating waves of biblical finality. He tries to say, “I’m gonna guess an Eden.” But it comes out ***“An End.”***

What? That’s not what he meant. He tries again several times. *“An end. An end? An end! An… end. An end…”* By then his face feels hot. There is a buzzing cloud of insects in his mind. Fur under his fingers, him raking in tight breaths, looking into a dog’s face and trying to say good-bye.

***“Why do you fear death?”***

What the hell kind of question is that for an angel to be asking him *now?* Didn’t they bring him here with the unspoken understanding he was going to die? If he wasn’t ready to do that for the people of Earth, or even just for his sister and his parents, then why would he have come? If this is what it takes to fix it, then what other choice does he have?

So why ask him if he’s afraid? You don’t guide a lamb to the slaughter and then stop with the knife in your hand and say, “Are you sure you want to do this?” You don’t want them stuck there anticipating, soaking in the immensity of the realization that this is what your life has amounted to. You surprise the lamb. Make it quick and painless. Kind if you can manage it.

Of course the frightening thing is the clarity. All the buzzing turmoil has been pushed into the distance of his mind. In its place is the vision of the angel, like someone forced to visualize the feeling of having a gaze on you without being allowed to use the symbolism of an eye. A humanoid figure that itself contracts to focus in on you.

The angel is doing something to him. It isn’t even subtle. It’s Abraham on a hilltop, tying his son to an altar while the kid’s asking him what’s happening. There is clear ritual to the questions the angel is asking him, to the way his being responds almost on its own to them. And yes of course David’s afraid to die. The reasons he might be afraid are so obvious. It’s *death*. But the question hits deeper, slides along that spike in his center and seeps into the cracks in the pillar of his being, posing some other, harsher question to him. And he can’t answer it. Anything pithy dies in his throat (double-metaphor, since breathing doesn’t even exist here). Anything earnest falls short of coalescing into words. David likes to think his will is strong, that he can make himself do what he knows is right regardless how the rest of his being revolts.

 As he stands there paralyzed, struggling to find a way to answer, dreading the moment he does, the briefest shadow seems to pass over the angel and the Sword. Mustang’s voice cuts through the crushing silence at the End of the Bridge, and David returns to himself.

|Mere|

Just as Mere feared, Lenn is not waiting at the end of the Bridge to meet them.

Mere suffers when she approaches the end of the Bridge. She concedes that the thing at the end could be a Sword in some higher sense, but the thing is too brilliant and terrible to risk giving her full attention. It’s shrouded in light, and the weight of that shroud seems in turns to be either the evening glory that fell on the marbled walls of Naris in her childhood or the blaze that toppled them while she was truant. It may not show the same face to everyone who approaches, but Mere’s impression is that in the presence of the Sword one finds that the Now becomes staked through the blasted remains of that palace, Memory, and the humors that expel from Memory’s wounds in turn paint a frantic sunset of gilded loss. The figure of the angel, just a ghost in Mere’s periphery, still portends enough posture to lend the sense that this time it is not distracted by the demands of Lenn’s presence. It seems to watch her with the wary and sad regard of a healer at the bedside of the surely doomed.

Because of the edifice of dread this raises in her, Mere avoids coming to the end of the Bridge alone out of outright necessity. She would not come at all if the obligations of her office did not demand it. Were she to venture here of her own accord, with no others’ affairs to attend, would she find herself caught in the grasp of questions voiced by an angel? Now is difficult enough, given that the nature of this visit and some outside influence have conspired to render the rest of the Bridge as an unbounded eternity stuffed with fathomless volumes of ash. It’s created an almost unbearable contrast: the ceaseless tangle of the dark against the unyielding light of a promised end.

For fear of inviting the angel to address her, she dares not dwell on questions about why this place has manifested this way to her, but Mere cannot keep the questions out of her own heart, so she permits some she hopes will do less harm in the moment. What does Persaval see here? How does the Sword tease the longings and regrets of that poor man’s heart? Especially with the Circle’s bonds scattered, any insight into that question is closed to her. Still his tension tightens his moments as they draw ever closer to the grandeur of Finality.

And what of this boy David, whom she marches across a Bridge towards what can only be considered his death? Is this truly the path wrought for him? And does she have a choice? She is a Falcon again, but this time more like a nesting mother who bears a still-wriggling mouse in her talons to offer up its life for the survival of her charges.

A whisper like honey on burnt toast tells her that this is what she was promised. She was always meant to inherit--commit-- embody this horror. Mere rebukes that voice, rubbing a finger along the Iron Ring on her left index, but it cannot be silenced. It is sealed away, no direct danger to Veneth or the Bridge, but a fragment of it still worms its way through her soul. She had hoped that maybe by some good fortune she could banish it more thoroughly once they succeeded in cursing Thrast, but even he is not truly gone yet. The whisper of that hungry distant realm uses the tenor and cadence of her own voice. It assures her that she should never fear to lose its companionship.

*The boy*, Mere insists to herself. *How is this affecting the boy*? She turns to regard him.

David is frozen in place, eyes large to take in the sight of a flaming Sword the size of a building plunged into the stonework of the Bridge. His expression is slacked, as if his attention has drifted elsewhere even as he faces the end. Both of Persaval’s hands are on the boy’s shoulders now, an attempt by the Arbiter to guide or assure or forestall some fomenting danger, or some combination of all of those things.

“It’s David,” the boy says.

Persaval looks Mere in the eyes. He looks to the End.

Mere’s hackles rise.

With a tone like he is answering a question Mere did not hear, David says, “We’re here to talk to Lenn.”

Persaval pulls David back a step up the Bridge. He asks where his husband is. The boy doesn’t seem to notice either of these things.

Mere says, “He did not remain here.”

Persaval’s eyes flick from the End to Mere again. “We should also be gone.”

David says, “An end.” His eyes widen further, startled at the words that escaped him. He speaks again, quickly, and increasingly distraught, “An end. An end? An end! An… end. An end…”
Persaval tries to drag David back another step, but the boy digs his feet in and somehow, despite straining with effort, Persaval cannot get him to budge. He asks, “Is this why you really brought him here? To offer him up?”

Mere feels her own body stiffening. “Questions are dangerous here, Sworn Sword. Here, of all places, the Question begs an answer.”

“Answer me, Mere.”

She studies the boy’s face. Can he hear them while the angel burns its Questions? Maybe not. 

She says, “To rid us of Thrast, David must take the departure offered here and carry Thrast with him beyond.”

“Oh?” Persaval’s protective grip on David tightens.

“Can’t you feel it?” Mere hears herself say. “The pressure. Can you smell the musk of Thrast on him? Does it not convict you?”

“You said questions are dangerous,” Persaval observes. “Where is my husband, Mere?”

“I cannot know without searching.”

Persaval says, “I cannot do it thus.” His eyes fall on the boy. Some hidden reserve within him coils and strikes. He asks, “David, can you hear me?”

As if startled awake, the boy turns his head. “What?”

Something releases for Mere as well, but she feels the attention of the angel turning toward her again. She says, “I may have been mistaken. Lenn is not here, and that raises questions about the path ahead. Arrows drawn in sand, David. I must regather our bonds. While I do, none should remain here at the End.” 

Whatever grave but brief misalignment took her before has righted itself. She turns her head and wills up a doorway back to what should be a safe region on Veneth. It is one of sturdy reddish oak, and blessedly it conjures with it a slice of overcast sky. Even that glimpse of gray, melancholic cloudscape brings a flare of relief from the oppressive emptiness that had surrounded them. She guides them to the doorway, opens it with the Gilded Sword, then hurries toward her own passage as they escape the black.

Hers is not a door at all. Instead it is the entrance to a hollow on a wintry mountainside. She welcomes the bracing cold, the stinging wet of a blast of snowy air that tries to fend her off, as she plunges through and escapes the eyeless gaze of the End that awaits her.

She hopes that Persaval is right, and that they have not just thrown away their last chance at sparing Veneth from Thrast’s ministrations.
