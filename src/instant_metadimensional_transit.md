# Instant Metadimensional Transit

The first thing David loses is his balance. His bearings follow just after, and they drag his composure along with them.  He is, all that to say and to no one’s surprise, unprepared for instant metadimensional transit. In the stories he’s been told there’s always a moment of transition, a space passed through however briefly on the way to the startling new context. There's no transition here, except maybe in the parsing his brain does as it scrambles to re-model reality for his waking mind out of a new set of stimuli. Before there was just pressure building: that pre-break ache he was trying to ignore by blaring music and keeping his hands busy. Now something’s given near his center and there’s a hook through his heart on a line pulled taut.
Light hits his eyes first, of course, but it’s darker here than in the family bathroom, and with no transition between bathroom and tower his eyes are caught adjusting while he notices other things. He tastes smoky air as he gasps it in to fill his lungs; he hears a couple drops of water from his brush sizzle when they strike something on the floor; he feels a cushioning puff of something powdery and still hot when he lands on his ass. Only then does his vision resolve.
When his eyes refocus, David discovers he’s in a room with a man and a woman who are also startled. This room is doorless, windowless, and empty except two distinct piles of ashes and the three of them close enough to huddle up together. David is sitting in one of the ash mounds, the water from his brush going drip-sizzle drip-sizzle.
The onlookers are shaken by the suddenness of the change as well, though both expected something significant to happen when Mere spoke the curse into being. Mere has lived through far more disturbing experiences than the sight of an oddly-dressed adolescent landing in the smoldering ashes of her enemy’s puppet body. Persaval, though less accustomed to the strange, by nature holds his surprise at a remove. The degree of their surprise comes more from how mundane David is.
They see a pale youthful face screwed up in confusion. David is both a little short and a little scrawny, wearing the kind of clothes you’d expect a recent high school graduate to wear when he’s cleaning the bathroom: an over-washed t-shirt and some sweatpants. In the back of his mind Persaval’s first impression of modern American clothing is that the people who would create such clothes must be lazy, since it all seems designed to be put on and off easily. The clothing hardly registers to Mere except that it clearly is not garb from Veneth, and by a rapid string of conclusions she arrives at a pained suspicion about the nature of a boy from another realm suddenly appearing on Veneth.
Mere moves first, raising a warning hand towards Persaval. To David she looks, like, 39. Short dark brown coat and slacks, both swarming with buttoned pockets (some of which are bulging). Her gesture draws David’s eyes to the mask she holds in her warning hand: a full-face red falcon mask fashioned from feathers and polished wood. She holds the mask with two fingers at one bottom corner, her fingers poised with a care that suggests the mask is both precious to her and somehow more of a violent object to wield than the sword in her other hand. She holds that at her side in a loose grip. It’s covered in gold decoration. Her hair’s in a crown braid; her posture implies an actual crown would belong just fine. She says, “I did not expect this.”
David notes that Persaval1 is in uniform, something white and pristine, but his weapon’s on fire. David figures that tracks with the ash heaps. The flames from that weapon are the only source of light in the room. The man stares at David like you watch the road for deer after one darts in front of your car.
Then the man’s face sinks fractionally. His eyes flick down. They tag Mere before fixing on David again to be sure he hasn’t moved. Persaval says, “I don’t feel him.” His voice hitches when he says “him.” “The Circle?”
She says, “The bonds are only scattered.”
“And this lad?” The man gestures with his firebrand. Since there's no other light in this room, the way the light shifts with the gesture feels to David a little like a floodlight pinpointing him.
She doesn’t answer the man. Instead she disappears that falcon mask into one of her countless pockets, then lowers herself to her knees in front of David. Her head is frighteningly close to the flames of the soldier’s weapon, and that makes half her face disappear into shadows.
She asks, “Are you well?”
Looking into that half face, drawn with somber lines of flickering orange-red light, David cannot help but feel his confusion burning away into dread. That sense he’s lived with all his life, the pressure that’s been hammered out into fishing wire pulling at his center, is tangled with a terrible certainty. As he reels with that, his tongue stays locked behind his teeth.
“Do you understand me?” she asks next.
The firelight bobs from an impatient motion Persaval makes.
David draws another deep breath of smoky air. He nods.
The woman says, “I am Mere. You are safe here for now.”
It clicks for Persaval. He mutters, “Ambergris,” a curse. 
“Please,” Mere says, “I’m so sorry, but please, if you can answer me this: do you come from a land with many people?”
A different anticipation rises in David, turning his “Why” into a croak of preliminary grief.
“Unless we are swift,” the woman answers, “they are all doomed.”
David squeezes his eyes shut. 
This boy, who has been treading water through an uncertain summer after graduating from high school, who has few friends if any, and who already suffers under a constant sense of dread, has just been blinked off of Earth. Inside two minutes of this switch being flipped he is told by an armed stranger that time is short and his entire world (or universe?) is in danger. This is a moment out of which might spring any number of different combinations of human emotion, many of which he has already seen modeled in abstract from the many stories he has consumed. Knowing, in general, what writers and actors imagine happens to a young person in this situation does absolutely nothing to prepare him for it.
David makes what he concludes to be his only choice, to the mild shock and utter heartbreak of those who witness it. He opens his eyes and stands (leaving the toilet brush in the ashes) and shakily says, “Okay. What do you need me to do?”
Mere has risen with David. The shock, and the new fault line it leaves in its wake, she quickly spackles over with the blank of business. She says, “Come with me,” and turns away.
“I’d ask where,” David says, “but I don’t see how it would make a difference.”
As David’s talking, Mere draws a line with the tip of her sword on one wall of the room. A door appears within the border of that line. It must stand almost ten feet from the floor to the ceiling, and it is formed entirely from a dark and glossy wood. Where the handle should be, there is a large gilded keyhole.
Persaval says, “I would also like to know.”
“I had thought you would guess it,” Mere says, sliding her sword into the door’s keyhole. It goes in up to the hilt, which in turn now looks like an overly long doorknob.
Persaval says, “I want to hear it.”
Mere turns the hilt-knob. “We will consult your husband.”
As the door creaks open Persaval asks, “Is that wise?”
“The boy is bound for the Sword regardless.”
David takes a few steps to get a better angle at the opening the door just made in the room, but Persaval stays on him, and that light obscures what might be beyond.
David asks, “Do we have time for questions?”
Mere answers, “On the way.” 
She finishes pulling the door open, showing David that the space beyond is black. His first thought is that it’s night, but as David and the man with the weird torch approach the doorway it becomes clear that instead it’s a huge stone bridge in an endless teetering void. A short set of stairs connects their door to that bridge. Visible across the bridge is another set of stairs leading to a different door, glimmering and translucent.
Persaval says, “Something is wrong.”
“I will admit this permutation is ominous,” Mere says, “but Lenn awaits with our answers.”
With a curt nod and no further complaint, the officer moves to usher David through the door after Mere.
David asks, “What’s wrong with the Bridge?” No answer.
He follows Mere across the threshold. His head becomes lighter immediately. There’s no hand-rail on the steps leading down to the bridge, which seems like a great way to leave you a clumsy step away from an eternal fall into the nothing. David moves carefully: step, shuffle, step, shuffle, step; he clears the stairs onto the broad, guarded stone. When he turns his head and looks up the bridge (or down it, how could you tell?) his eyes water. He locks his gaze on Mere’s back instead. After Persaval passes through the doorway, it closes out of existence. They feel it close, each imagining the soft click and the change in pressure, but as quickly as the resonance of the moment strikes it passes over them.
Persaval is dead-quiet. Not just non-verbal: his steps, breath, and clothing make no sound. The only reason David knows that Persaval also came through is because he’s put his hand on David’s shoulder.
David tries to keep his eyes fixed on Mere. She is one stride ahead of him, moving with the confidence of a captain walking the deck of her ship during a battle or a storm. There’s tension there, but it’s worn down into a kind of comfort. Here on this bridge, which draws David’s mind out to lengths beyond sight and whose very existence sets David on edge, Mere is home. He tries to keep focused on that, but the weight of the bridge laid out in front of them draws his eyes up.
That hook in him, that tight line his sense of impending doom has become, is lined up straight with the direction of the bridge. And it tightens further. It feels like he’ll be yanked off his feet any moment and go plummeting towards whatever waits at the end of the Bridge.
The hand on David’s shoulder tightens, but the sensation is strange. It’s like it’s Persaval’s fingers that give, the way David imagines stone would feel when someone pushes on it.
David tries to draw a breath to speak, and realizes then that he cannot suck air into his lungs--that there is no air here for him to breathe--yet his intended words seem to sound even as his mouth is startled frozen. Those words ring in the abyssal dark around the bridge. “I was going to ask questions.” Struck by the strange sensation, he tries to force a chuckle, but there isn’t even the shadow of laughter to escape him. 
He says, “Dear God there’s no air in here how am I talking scratch that how are my lungs not exploding what is this place and why is it so hollow?”
“This is a Realm of Extension,” Mere says. “It is shaped by the thoughts and wills of those who walk its path. Everything but the path itself is transient, here.”
David means to say, “Oh,” but the thought that niggles in his mind in response is what sounds instead, “But there’s nothing here except the path. And these doors.”
As they continue, David takes note of the doors. There is a door of earthen reddish wood with pull handles, a gray fence-gate shrouded in fog, a once-broken iron door whose cracks are filled with gold, an open arch of flowers, and, for just a moment, a plain off-white door with something nailed to its face. When he tries to look closer at any of them, but especially the last one, the doors have vanished like they were never there.
Finally, Mere answers, “There is some will suppressing the way the realms normally mingle at the edges here. I trust it is not you, Sworn Sword?”
The flavor of Persaval’s shifting, uncomfortable silence is that it is not him forcing the Bridge into a strangling, nihilistic blackness.
Distracted, David asks, “That’s not your name, is it? Sword?” He finds he prefers the strange nature of speech over crushing silence.
“A title: Sworn Sword, or Arbiter.”
“I don’t do titles. Can we try again? My name is David. I’m from Earth, the place that her majesty just admitted is imminently doomed. You are?”
The guy doesn’t answer.
“Fine, I’ll choose for you,” David says. “You get to be Mustang. Why is my planet doomed?”
An old cabin door, several of its planks shattered and the whole thing snapped off its hinges, passes them in the dark.
After Mustang pauses too long again, it’s Mere that answers. “A man is strangling Veneth,” she says. “We undertook to dispel him from this realm with a curse. Though he seems to have been expelled, there appears to be one more step required to seal his exile.”
“I appeared where he disappeared, so you think he will be in my place?”
“Until we complete the curse,” Mere says.
David thinks of his parents, off running errands, and of his sister, and the phone call that stressed him out enough to start compulsively cleaning. He says, “How do we do that?”
“I have a suspicion,” Mere answers, “but I want to confirm it with Lenn.”
“Is that Mustang’s estranged husband?”
Mustang’s fingers flex against David’s shoulder again. There is the ghost of pressure in it, but only to a point. It’s clearer from the guy’s shift in posture than anything his shoulder feels. He wonders, has his arm gone numb? David turns to see Mustang’s scowl.
Persaval allows himself to think that he preferred when David was confused and despondent, but even as he uses that thought to mask more tangled ones Persaval lets it burn for being a misdirected flare of aggression. Even with the divisive force of his own will he cannot separate himself from the dread he feels looking this boy in the eyes, so he does David the kindness of an honest view of his displeasure. 
 Mere says, “Lenn drew out the terms for the curse. He will best know how we need to proceed.”
“Where does this Bridge lead?” David asks.
Mustang says, “Its end.”
Mere says, “Wherever one is headed to, with some exceptions.”
“So I could find my way home from here?”
“If you knew where to look.”
The stone feels like it turns beneath David’s feet. He turns his head with the sensation, and swears that for a hot second he can see that white door again, the one with a poster on it, atop a set of carpeted stairs that have branched from the Bridge. When he looks closer for it, though, there’s nothing.
David asks, “Will you tell me how?”
“There isn’t time.”
“Looks like a long walk.”
Mere pauses. “There is no time here.”
David says, “Uh.”
“I told you this is a realm of Extension. This is not a place the way the tower was. What illusions of flesh and presence you experience here are projections. When the thought of our passage is completed, so too will our arrival complete.”
“I… what? If we get there ‘when’ we get there, don’t we have as much space for conversation as it takes?”
“You are already wandering dangerously,” Mere says. “Say you are drawing an arrow in the sand on a beach. You have in mind to what the arrow should point, but you allow yourself to be distracted by an unusually large wave, or the sounding of a gull. Your line not only wavers, but the arrow gestures askew, towards some other object you know not what, and the thought you meant to share is lost even before the tide can clear it from the sands.
“I will not be diverted from the course, so while I have permitted your questions so far I cannot stop to teach you all the wonder and peril of wandering the realms.” 
Surely enough, as she finishes David spots a shape in the distance. Yet this is the beginning of our story. We cannot begin with the Separation that concludes it, though it is coming. We must begin with an introduction to the pieces, a mini play to foreshadow the larger work, and there are pieces we don’t see while we’re watching this premature march toward the Sword that Seals All Fates.
So is this where I digress? With a bit of authorial machination, do we cut away the moment before David first encounters the angel?
