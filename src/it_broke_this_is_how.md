# It Broke. This is How.

It’s always five.

One. David is a little boy riding on Daddy’s shoulders, and Lila’s holding Daddy’s hand, and together they find a part of the yard where they can peer past the branches into the clear and starry sky. Kyle’s been teaching them the constellations. He names Cassiopeia, and Lila points out the “W” drawn by five stars. He tells them about Perseus, and Andromeda, and the creature of the deep they faced together because of the arrogance of Cassiopeia. Lila asks if Andromeda gets to fight the monster. David asks if they have to kill it.

Two. Lila makes it home from the vet before their parents. She finds David, a freshman, sitting on his bed, his puffy red eyes fixed on his hands. She whispers, “David,” and his first instinct is to kick the door shut. But she lingers. She says his name again, softer. The door opens and he sags into her waiting hug. They stand there crying till their parents get home. There isn’t anything they can say, except when they hear the front door open and David manages to confess, “I couldn’t go with you.” Lila shushes him, assures him that it’s okay. That it’s over. That Giddy looked so peaceful in the end. David says he’s sorry. Lila repeats that it’s okay to hurt.

Three. Mom and Dad are having the weekly family call with Lila, off at college, after supper while David is trying to finish his homework. Lila mentions somewhere she went that week instead of one of her evening classes, and almost immediately the call turns into an argument. Mom says, “You can make your own choices, honey, but we’re not paying your tuition so you can neglect your studies.” Without really looking up from his textbook, David tells his sister goodnight and removes himself to his room. On his way up he hears Lila ask if they wanted her to lie.

Four. Lila brings a guy home for Thanksgiving. Montgomery Alexander Rutherford Kensington (Mark) is a charming, chill, and startlingly rich trust fund kid. He’s an instant hit and it’s mutual. Within weeks he’s part of the Adamson household’s DNA, not by some great virtuosity but because he treats them all with such a genuine regard. They forget, for a while, the friction with Lila running underneath the surface. But like so many omens that have bubbled out into naked misfortune throughout his youth, David feels an unease growing right along with the Adamson family’s bond with Mark. He doesn’t bring it up with Lila, because she is growing increasingly distracted by Mark, school, work, her activism, and anything else that keeps her from having to spend too much time with their parents. David’s busy too, trying to sneak his way through his last two years of high school without anyone noticing that he has no idea what to do with himself. The pressure builds.

Five. David’s in the kitchen washing dishes while Lila tosses her life out with the trash. That’s how Mom frames it later, anyway. She follows Lila outside like a frost nipping at her daughter’s heels. Jenna Adamson does not say, “Don’t walk away from me.” Why would she? She’s ice, and every glimpse of the frigid line of her spine aligning with the unbent corners of her mouth sets Lila on fire.

What do they say out in the snow? Lila slams the trash can opened and closed. She gets something on her fingers and dry-washes her hands before burying them in her jacket pocket. Is it about the ring, or Dad’s birthday, or about how Lila has slowly edged herself out of the family? When the shouting starts, they’re talking about him. Then the shouting cuts off, and Lila takes off. She leaves Mark behind; she goes blazing out into the night. A few miles down the road she pulls over and puts on her jacket and cries.

It gets real still at the Adamson house that night Lila leaves. The stillness starts almost before she’s gone. It’s like the storm of her fiery argument with Mom and the ice-knife severance from Mark are only the final tuning notes of cacophony before the hush when the conductor raises his baton, but what should have been a quiet pause becomes the whole performance. David, cursed constant spectator, punctuates that performance by turning the water off, dishes in the sink half-done, and taking fifteen measured steps from the kitchen to the door of his room. The door creaks open, he slips inside, and the latch clicks. It doesn’t slam, but like the rest of the trappings for this evening it feels final.

The pressure in his room is different from that in the common spaces of the house, but the theatrical stillness still mutes the world. David steps around a pile of his clothes on the floor and places himself cross-legged in the middle of his bed. He pulls out his phone but leaves it in his lap at first. A breath. One. Two. Three. Four. He holds it longer than he maybe should.
His attempt to break the performance is deliberate, methodical, and somehow fruitless. He dials his sister’s number digit by digit rather than tap her name from the two-item list of favorite contacts. He presses the screen where it displays an icon of a green phone, and a ringtone perforates Lila’s sail.

She picks up.

“You know, you didn’t actually say good-bye,” he says.

Lila performs stillness while she swallows her sobbing.

David says, “I wanna say something that doesn’t suck. Don’t know what to say to help you right now. But—”

“David,” Lila says.

He says, “Can you keep in touch? I won’t let Mom know.”

“Little brother, this is not your fault.”

“I know,” David says, “But I’m paying for it.”

“Do you want me to apologize?”

“Want you not to leave.”

A stretching silence.

“I need to figure this out for myself, and it’ll keep getting worse if I stay. We’re all just hurting each other.”

“You weren’t hurting me.”

Lila eventually says, “Don’t worry, I’ll call you. But it’s gonna be crazy for me for a while.”

“You’ll figure it out. You always figure it out.”

“Thanks. I gotta get back on the road now.”

“Text me when you’re back safe.”

She hangs up. He doesn’t see her again, in person, until after she dies.
