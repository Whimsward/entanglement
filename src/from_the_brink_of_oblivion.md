(Content from the chapter wherein Lila struggles and resurfaces from the brink of oblivion)

Lila is, to no one’s surprise, not prepared for the consequences of an instant metapsychic split.

When Annabeth Oakley was presented with what her descendants would call the Oakley ring it was set with a modestly-sized garnet. Annabeth then gave it to her daughter Rebecca, represented by a sardonyx of similar size. Rebecca added a sapphire for Jenna, but she also had another setting prepared when she did, so that when Jenna handed the ring down to Lila she was compelled both to fill a setting with Lila’s amethyst and prepare another empty one, where the gem from Lila’s daughter would continue the tradition. Like Rebecca, Jenna never discussed this expectation with her daughter. She only gave Lila the ring and said, “My mother gave me this when I came of age. Now I’m giving it to you.” 

In lieu of the expected precious stone the eye of the flower is a small, gleaming ember. Within the ring the slurry of fear and anger that is panic spills into a chasm that is her devastation at the results of her gambit, and a dozen other lesser but still stringent colors of passion contribute to the blackbody radiation the band of the Oakley ring is now emitting in the visible spectrum. Thus, the inside of Lila’s car is on fire.

How does a mind work after it has been crammed into a smartphone? Synapses are traded for chip-boards. Compartmental schema contort into the shapes of apps and functions. Sensory input from her body is set aside in favor of the receiver, accepting packets of data borne on light-waves for her to parse. 

The parts of Lila that evaluate information, sort it, and enable her to act on it are cut off from her. She cut them off. So the vessel from which she’d planned to conduct her newly partitioned life instead leaves her mind wrestling in streams of light she lacks the perspective to understand. And while the mind wrestles, the flames of decentralized panic only grow hotter.

Separated from mind and spirit to govern the engine of her will, the body that houses her Domination lies dormant. Without the essence of life to fuel the engine and foster those infinitesimal deeds of her cells necessary to continuously maintain everything that makes an organism alive (firing synapses, respiration, circulation, cell division, biochemical combustion…), Lila is, simply, dead.

Her homespun scarf spins more of itself, seeking life to foster and chaos to bring to order. But without models to follow, paths to take, or the will to do, the threads, like sprouts, can only grow towards a source of energy. Most, then, spread too close to the ring and are consumed by the rising flames in the cabin of the car, but in doing so they provide a buffer between her corpse and self-immolation. 

The buffer will not last forever. The hand that wears the Oakley ring is already a  smoldering husk, and the heat is crawling up to consume more of her arm. A magnificent intent means nothing if you lack the will to take it up.

If the Oakley ring is her spirit inflamed, her phone is her scattering mind, her body is her dormant flesh suit, and her scarf is aimless Vita, then what is or will become of the jacket with which she made her disastrous division? It is the scalpel dropped between the tray and the table; it is the walls of a tower built without doors or windows. Yes, the same lines drawn to Separate her vessels are keeping much of the heat of her spirit from consuming her other selves, but the heat licks through unmanned gaps in those walls. Her Edge should have written a comma between “I will partition myself” and “and then I will,” but instead it punched a period.

No, Lila was not ready. But her spirit is not bound by her former arrangement, and the exothermic consequences of that are only passive. Lila inhabits the Oakley ring, and she is free to compose:

> That's not how it is
> 
> Lila is not an essay
>
> She is poetry
>
> Lady on Fire paint yourself wearing five faces
>
> Mind tick to airplane, listen it stills cacophony
>
> Will and direction meet in her body wakening
>
> Life that's untangled kindles the breath of industry
>
> Severed selves seize your liberty, tear the car apart

Lila shambles away from the ruptured shell of her burning Saturn and out into the driveway. Her feet scrape the asphalt, then stiffen. She takes in a breath like water trickling through a blocked drain. 

> What fires wrought this heart?
>
> This woman now disjointed
>
> What will she be like?
>
>
> Why did we make Lila
>
> A concept to work toward
>
> Are we building something here
>
> Is this breath I'm taking
>
> The first or the last
>
> You made a hard choice
>
> Mind the path it takes
>
> Walk it while you can
>
> Build and not tear down
>
> What step do I take
>
>
> Next?
>
>
> Align my selves, assign my mind the throne
>
> I'll be the voice behind the president
>
> My arms will carry out what we decide
>
> The thread I weave will keep us all alive
>
> And Edge will line the bones of precedent

Lila holds her breath. She chose the responsibility to sustain life. It’s best she starts with herself.

Her spirit’s excess heat is siphoned away at her mind’s direction and by her will expressed in extending her arm and spreading cracked and blackened fingers. The heat from the ring is converted into energy to serve Vita in repairing her body. Edge starves the flames and excises flesh that can’t be rescued, clearing the way for Vita’s threads to weave a sleeve of fabric all the way down to her wrist. Her hand remains a skeletal husk as a reminder to her selves of what happens when she plays with fire.

Lila exhales. It’s a start. As her panic recedes, the flare of heat powering her healing recedes to a steady flicker. Her spirit finds this good, and her mind seeks to make that useful.

She proceeds with turning her turmoil into quanta of healing: electrical signals and chemical energy. She misses things. The brain is now mostly a tool, and one already damaged by the shock of her transformation. The heart pumps, but the production of white blood cells is forgotten. The bacteria in her gut and the acid in her stomach have not stopped working, but with less fuel for Vita she finds the gestalt of her separate pieces sending fingers of blended magic to pick out food in her digestive system and transmute it directly into the fuel of her spirit. 

Fingers of magic that start within her stretch out loose from her body, snapping up asphalt and grass and vapor in the air and burning it as fuel to kickstart a new semblance of life. She recalls the sight of Thrast in the kitchen, claiming everything in sight as part of a new body. It occurs to her how easily he could have just taken the wealth of resources bound up in her body. It occurs to her that, during these moment of scrambling to recreate something recognizable out of her selves, she might not have the self-control to stop her selves from doing just that to any passers-by.

As if summoned by her thinking of him, Thrast returns. She feels him first, as she lets careful feelers of Extension stretch out from her. He descends to the end of the driveway as an armored nimbus of hastily manufactured flesh. His feet touch the asphalt and Lila looks him dead in his false eyes. Fury flares. Intent coils in her like a snake. As her withering gaze washes over him, before she can act, Thrast’s body collapses into a heap of ashes, and where it stood there is David.

There is no warning of this.

David sees Lila in the old worn jacket Mom bought her in high school and her homemade scarf thrown loose around her shoulders. Her hair is singed. One arm is tucked into her jacket out of sight. Her feet are scarcely touching the ground. She is sick-pale, not just white-girl-pale.

She sees David, yes, but first she feels him with a finger of Extension that had reached out to Thrast. Waves of her Association with him pulse out from her ring, and travel the line that connects them to find that magic has already laid hands on David. He carries a bundle, knotted around and into his soul. The bundle might as well have the name Thrast printed on the side in bold letters. Despite this knowledge, her eyes see only her brother, face contorting with alarm and horror.

“I’m back,” he says. He says, “Oh dear God I’m back.”
