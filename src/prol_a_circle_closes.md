# A Circle Closes

To enact a curse of banishment five must move as one. The five who dance that purpose are linked in a Circle of their intention: the queen walks a wooded path; the seer watches, yearning; the drifter approaches a figure on a bridge; the sovereign presses signet ring to molten wax; the swordsman stands atop a tower. Opposite these five is the wizard, the sole focus on which the Circle tightens, and opposite the wizard is one the Circle has not foreseen, he who stands on the other side of the axis on which the wizard will soon be cursed to turn: David Huxley Adamson, scrubbing the family toilet with a brush while on the phone with his sister.

[Association/Mere swish]

Mere, the Queen-errant, strides with purpose lest she stray from the narrow passage through this wood. Within her heart, in her countless pockets, and on her voice she carries the messages born from the hearts of the people of Veneth. That voice is needed to speak the banishment, but first she must tease out an off-beat rhythm in the Circle’s dance. She comes upon a parting of the ways. Not only do the woods part, but also their dappled sunlight and the illusion of place itself. Mere steps through the parting onto ancient, immaculate stone. Should she need to correct another’s steps she will have to do it quickly, but for now she wants to hear, perhaps for the last time, Lenn play his game of questions.

[Extension/Kella swish]

Huddled under a blanket in their snowed-in cave, Kella Aspenwood notes the queen’s boots moving from underbrush to stone, and realizes in that moment that the steps are off. For the curse to be finished, something in the Circle must be realigned. Kella is powerless to address this: it is her role to be present in Mere’s footsteps and Lenn’s absence, to hear the fraying of Anshall’s nerves and the feel the heat of Persaval’s flames. The others are one with Kella, an Extension of their being as it must be, for together they are her Circle, drawing across realms toward a singular purpose. Yet she has only the power to watch.

[Domination/Lenn swish]

Lenn, the Realmshorn, draws near to a vision: a giant’s blade that has been plunged into the mortar of the bridge and burns with pale fire. The Sword’s gravity tugs even at Lenn, but he is not free to succumb to its weight because he knows the truth: the Sword is not here on the Bridge. But though the Sword is not on the Bridge, its angel is. Lost Lenn puts a bold hand out as if to touch the flaming sword; the angel offers to send him beyond. Lenn recalls another sword of fire, parted from him, and he taps through the bloom of grief into his well of determination. With this determination he resists the true severance the angel offers him. Here, as so often, Lenn’s lost state has inverted the order of things: the angel is meant to ask questions first, and then make its offer. Perhaps with Lenn the offer comes first because the angel knows that it is dangerous, even for an angel, to play a game of questions with the Realmshorn.

[Edification/Anshall swish]

Anshall, Sovereign of the High Hall of Kolomaer, speaks nothing to his advisors and attendants as he watches one of his Knight-Heralds mount a horse in his audience hall and trot out into the sunlight. The whole and indelible will of the Sovereign of Kolomaer has been poured into the order the knight carries, yet Anshall still feels that order’s weight on his shoulders. It seems to him that his steps in this dance are the simplest: the Circle must have a firm foundation. Still Anshall sags in his high seat, knowing also that the first blow of a swift retribution will be to that same foundation.

[Separation/Persaval swish]

Persaval the Sworn Sword, Last Arbiter of Ea’river-that-was, climbs down from the peak of the fifth turret on the Western Tower of Thrast. He pauses, perched, outside the turret’s shuttered window. He raises a sword whose white-lacquered blade has never borne an edge. The wind dies. A red hot flame rises with the sword, encircling the man who holds it. The flames do not--cannot--touch Persaval, for the flames are his and meant to scour another. He coils, body and soul, in anticipation of breaching this tower to seek the object of their accursed dance. Then he blasts through the shutters with his fire and leaps in through the opening. The wall of the tower seals behind him as if there had never been a window at all.

[Association/Mere swish]

Mere feels Persaval’s leap for what it is: the first beat of the final cadence in the Circle’s dance. Time is short. With a half-sweep of the Gilded Sword she prepares a passage toward her own last steps, yet she lingers, waiting on the game.

[Extension/Kella swish]

Kella, watching, steals a breath for herself. Even if they could do more than watch, they must not, or risk throwing the game of questions askew.

[Domination/Lenn swish]

When it becomes clear Lenn will not take the offer, the angel asks, “What purpose brings you to this place?”

Beyond the balustrade of the Bridge there is only emptiness. Lenn answers the angel’s question with a question of his own, “How can Thrast be sent to the land beyond your watch?”

The angel itself contracts like an iris. “Who can force a soul beyond my vigil without their consent?”

The question confirms that despite years of careful planning the Circle has missed an essential step in the dance. Without a sacrifice the Circle’s trap will close on nothing but air. 

[Edification/Anshall swish]

Anshall’s lips move in soundless prayer.

[Separation/Persaval swish]

Persaval says, “Hello Thrast.”

The grand wizard Thrast, the tyrant of Ea’river, scourge of civilization, is sat at his desk. He is studying a sheet of records over a pair of spectacles. His body is past prime, thinner than it once was and draped in robes that seem to fill themselves rather than conform at all to the creature inside them. He does not at first acknowledge the figure of blazing fury that has burst into his chambers. Then the desk ignites, and Thrast reluctantly stands. There is, barely hidden by his robes, a single piece of jewelry on his person: an amber star now set in an earring, now in a fine arm band, now on a necklace. He holds out a placating hand towards Persaval, his whole frame bled of all its tension. 

He murmurs, “Welcome home, my Sworn Sword.”

 “I was never your Sword,” Persaval insists.

“You are Ea’river’s; therefore mine.”

“Not after what you’ve done.”

Thrast asks, “Why, then, have you come?”

[The Coin/David swish]

Sometimes David feels when something’s going to break. It’s that cinching in the center of him, like a kid choking off a garden hose as a prank, and it builds pressure till something bursts. Once it settles in there’s no stopping it till the break comes. Giddy put down. Lila breaking up with the whole family. At this point he does his best to ignore it: turn up the music, keep busy, and stay out of the way. He does it now and hardly notices. But there is a phone call.

[Association/Mere swish]

Mere has caught herself on purpose between two forces. The looming, indifferent absence surrounding the Bridge stretches into a swallowing-like pull towards the Sword at the End. The other pressure, her own compulsion to voice the will of Veneth’s people, pushes back on the gravity of the End, but it is a tenuous equilibrium. Hanging thus she strains to hear if the steps will be corrected: how might their hopes prove more than a cruel jest? It is in Lenn’s hands.

[Extension/Kella swish]

Kella clings to Mere’s shaky balance. They sketch its shape towards the hanging question. From Lenn she senses not surprise but resolution. She feels, as a fluttering in her own heart, the quivering fear in Anshall’s soul. And Persaval they can scarcely see at all through the heat of his rage and the cold sharp distance of his Separation.

[Domination/Lenn swish]

The Sword’s angel is tasked with asking questions. Those who arrive at its feet are meant to answer those questions until they find the one answer sufficient to convince them to depart either from or beyond the Sword. This game the Realmshorn plays, to answer only in questions, cannot be sustained for long, and Lenn knows that in the end he must provide the answer that is required. Resolute, he tugs on the still-gleaming cord of the Circle’s power, tied to him as to the rest. He sends a silent warning to the others, across two Realms, to brace themselves.

Lenn asks, “Can a soul be made to coax Thrast beyond?”

The angel asks, at a pace weighed down by the moment, “Ought there to be a soul bound up so?”

And Lenn, sighing and turning away from the Bridge to face another realm, distant and inert, answers, “There ought.”

[Edification/Anshall swish]

Anshall murmurs the sealing word of his prayer.

[Separation/Persaval swish]

In Thrast’s chambers, the light from Persaval’s flames begins to reflect another place: a field of green and golden grasses waving in a gentle breeze. Persaval recalls the humble cabin that stands somewhere just out of sight. He smells fresh bread.

Persaval’s lips peel back from his teeth.

Thrast watches the idyllic vision in the flames. “You don’t recall it clearly,” he says. The smell of woodsmoke billows, acrid, over the scent of bread. “There was so much blood.”

Persaval growls. “Blood you made him shed.”

Thrast puts a pair of fingers to his temple as if to nurse a headache. As if the body in this sweltering chamber is anything more than a puppet dangling on the wizard’s strings. He says, “The choice was always his.”

“As with Qastra’s [Steadfast] Legion?”

Thrast huffs. “You know,” he says. “Persaval, I showed you my vision. Can you prevent the coming Ruin? Because I can.”

The fires flare. “This isn’t righteousness,” Persaval says. “Souls reclaimed to senseless purpose. Nations bent into one will. How can you stand there pretending this is right?”

“Right?” The sound of laughter fills the room like a thunderclap. A wizard’s laugh, and all the while the mouth on Thrast’s body moves not at all. “Boy, I do what is necessary.”

Behind Thrast’s puppeted body, a path opens that was not there before.

“You seek to prevent the Ruin?” Persaval asks. “You carry it with you.”

Before Thrast can answer, a sword of gold and gray severs the arm from his body. The arm itself immediately fades to dust, but the armband set with an amber star that was on it clatters to the floor. Then Mere, Goddess of Messengers, holds a falcon mask up to her face and delivers a message from the Circle, the Sovereignty of Kolomaer, the ashes of the Hundred Halls, and the chorus of all Veneth, communicating the spirit of the missive which had been sent for this very tower signed and sealed by the Sovereign will of the High Hall: “Thrast, begone.”

The Circle’s bonds are shattered.

[The Coin/David]

When the moment’s haze passes, and as the flames die, there stands in the scorched tower chamber a wayward queen, a swordsman, and David Huxley Adamson holding a dripping toilet brush.
