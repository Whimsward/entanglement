# The Falcon Returns to Desolation

When she returns to Veneth after escaping Harrows, Mere fears to learn how much time has passed in her home realm. She goes to Naris to find it absolutely ruined, burned to the stones, a single smoldering branch of the trees in the Court of the Gods remaining. Veneth itself seems to warn her who has done this, as if she didn’t know at the heart of her. But she needs the confirmation, so she travels.

First to Kolomaer, where a younger but still belabored Anshall welcomes her to the court and acknowledges what has happened (Qastra, Kolomaer, and the new nation of Ea’river worked together to destroy the nation). Second, Qastra to learn what has become of it, and its proximity to Goletha, where she learns that they have come to peace.

Here, or earlier, we should learn about the theory of the world that the people outside the Wilds hold: there are, and should be, Five Nations. Whenever the balance of the nations shifts, it tends towards an equilibrium. Nations are then read to play the roles of different Paradigms in their international affairs. As Thrast consolidates his power, it seems to those outside that he is breaking this pattern.

Somewhere, I should show Thrast’s alternative view, his reading of his vision leads him to the conclusion that the Five must be One, and he is destined to make it so or the world he knows will come to ruin. He is also counting countries. As he takes Dominion over more of them, he simply counts them as under himself. So part of the impetus behind the Circle’s prologue action is their belief that there is only one nation left unclaimed (Kolomaer).

Lenn does not fuck with this. It’s something he and Persaval can’t talk about because Persaval is basically incapable of seeing the mistake for what it is. Generally, Lenn tries to be gentle and kind, trying many different ways to illustrate the problem. He only tries once to tell Persaval outright that the Wilds are not an abberation for Veneth. He doesn’t quite know how to express (nor would Persaval believe) that the Wilds are Veneth, and it is the “Five Nations” that unusual, and outliers. Because argue as he might, Lenn knows that they will hear that as an accusation that they are “evil.”

So he devises a way to try to force Veneth’s hand.

I want to stretch out the story of the first forming of the Circle and not just dump it into the last Mere flashback of Part I. I can lay the track and leave the reader to wonder a bit.

But I want to break it. I want Part V to be a sundering in a significant way. A new nation emerging? No Veneth is going to start vacuuming up its little satellite Places. Departure and return, motherfuckers.
