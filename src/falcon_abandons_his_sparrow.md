| Flashback |

Years later, the Falcon and his Sparrow returned to the Temple of Answered Questions. The Wilds had not shifted in that time, as if fixated on the view of the storms on the Sea of Goletha. Now there was no attendant to the temple, and the young mother had long since moved to the Indomitable City with her child, Thrast.

Mere could catch glimpses of that city from their perch in the open air entrance to the temple. The amber light cast by early sunset washed over the ever-storming sea. It was not quite enough to make the sea seem to catch fire, and part of what defied that effect was the intermittent sight of dark gray walls, high and defiant amidst the turbulent waters. Some had suggested it was not the storms that constantly darkened Goletha, but the city that had been built at its heart.

The people of Goletha were widely regarded as violent and exploitative, using the paradigmatically indestructible walls of their home city as a fortress within which to hoard centuries of plunder they took from the nations that bordered their sea with their massive warships. They permitted no other vessels to weather the storms within, and also refused to agree to the building of a Marshall’s Gate within their city’s walls. It was of course not the only truth about Goletha. They had taken in the woman and her child without a moment’s hesitation on discovering her.

“I could not do it,” the Falcon told her again. 

She told him she knew.

The Falcon was wrung out. It seemed as if it was difficult enough for him just to sit in silence and watch the distant sea. He would hardly eat. He would hardly speak, except to try to teach Mere more of what she would need to know to take on his mantle when he was finished.

“Why have we returned here?” Mere asked.

He did not answer.

“You did not even give the pretext of repairing the Gate this time. Why do you dwell on that night?”

“Do you remember our meeting?”

“I cannot forget.”

The Falcon said, “You have always sworn to me that you did not steal into the Court of the Gods, that the tree you climbed was very nearly outside the city itself. I took this for truth. Something outside of yourself forced you into a necessary moment. Perhaps you were briefly aligned with the dislocation of the Wilds. Perhaps the track of history demanded your presence.

“I have known such compulsions throughout my service as the God of Messengers. Veneth herself at times requires me to carry a message or to bear witness. But nothing has felt so dire a compulsion as to see the birth of that child, and never before have I been commanded by my brethren to defy it with such violence.

“My Sparrow, that child is the herald of ruin, and I am utterly convinced that I have doomed us all by sparing his life.”

Mere said, “It seems to me that the child is just a child.”

“I can no longer walk a path of conscience,” the Falcon said. “I have neither the strength nor the resolve to continue to serve.”

Mere scraped her hands in bolting to her feet. She had thought it would be soon, but not tonight. And not this way.

She said, “I am not ready to become the Falcon.”

“I am sorry, my Sparrow.” He took off the mask.

The world seemed to darken.

For the first time she saw his face, and it was so young. There were no wrinkles or laugh lines. There was none of the leatheriness of aging. But those eyes were hard, dull points. His mouth pulled down tight at the corners. If he felt anything, showing his true face to his apprentice of ten years for the first and last time, he did not show it.

But she could not help but read that expression as disappointed.

With all the animus of a puppet, the man who was once the Falcon swept to his feet and carved a door from the air in a single motion. It was a stone door, matching a little of the aesthetic of the temple. A door for a tomb. The once-Falcon plunged through that door and Mere was forced to follow.

She stumbled out onto the Bridge. This time, her master’s will held sway, so the environment that surrounded the bridge was that of the storming sea of Goletha, with patches of golden sunset cliffs that always felt like they were fast retreating into history.

Mere said, “What are you doing?”

His answer was to travel. The weight of his intentional silence carried them along the Bridge in a whorl of motion. Countless doors seemed to pass them in moments. Mere tried to ask more questions about where they were going, or what his purpose was. But for the illusion of moments all she could fathom was the image of the man who had been the Falcon striding down the Bridge with the mask of his office in one hand and the Gilded Sword in the other.

They came to an End with a startling speed. Clearly, whatever resolve remained with the once-Falcon was bent on this. The End was overwhelming. Unreadable. Like standing before the sun itself as it set.

Surprisingly, the Falcon turned to face her.

“Skittering across the borders of realms as we do exacts,” he said. “Despite our oaths, and anything we do out of duty, we will find ourselves Separating from the natural order of the place that was once our home. When it is your time to pass on, you too will have to come here to find the closure you will seek. Here at the End of the Bridge is a gate to the ending of all things.”

“I beg you to stay,” Mere said. This senseless realm did not allow her to move closer to her master--her father.

The Falcon cast the Gilded Sword down at her feet. “There is a tool older than the first of the Hundred Halls. With it you shall skirt the bounds of realms and rend the flesh of the unworthy.”

The flare of finality increased. They drew closer to the End. That face she saw so briefly was gone, washed away by the light. She could see only a figure now. Her eyes could only focus on that red-lacquered Falcon mask.

And suddenly the former God of Messengers was in arms’ reach.

“This is the heavier weight to carry. Its edges will cut you no matter how you try to hold it. The other Gods swear themselves to Naris’ Hundred Halls. You must swear to Veneth herself.”

“What if I don’t swear?”

He pressed the Falcon into her hands.

“If you cannot find another to carry it for you, the weight will crush Veneth.”

“This is what you can stomach?” she demanded. She was frightened. She was furious. “The one thing you can stand to do is to run away and dump it on your child?”

“Be better than me.”

The distance smeared again, and from what seemed near a mile off she saw her predecessor standing before the setting sun. Even from that false distance she could perceive the voice that rang out.

***“Who comes to stand before my vigil?”***

And for a terrible moment, Mere felt an attention on her, as she stood with the weight of the Falcon in her hands and the iron of the Gilded Sword at her feet. At first she thought it was the owner of the voice, somewhere in that blazing finality. But no, it was something else, somewhere else on or near the Bridge. It watched her. It pitied her. And it hungered.

She snatched up the Gilded Sword.
