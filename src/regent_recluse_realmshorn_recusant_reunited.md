# Regent, Recluse, Realmshorn, Recusant Reunited

| Mere |
| :---: |

As Mere passes through the threshold of the cave, the world itself twists, causing her to emerge onto the side of a cliff as if from the mouth of the cavern instead of plunging into its darkness. It is as cold and windswept as the Bridge forewarned. She tucks her arms in close, flaring her aura against the mountain gale as she adjusts.

She tries for the simplest way, despite knowing that it will not work. She turns on her heels, meaning to face the cavern entrance she should have passed into when she left the Bridge. The turn carries her farther than she aims, pointing her down a narrow, snow-laden mountain pass. There is a little taste of something like the Wilds here on this mountain. Did she who dwells in the mountain summon that incoherence from elsewhere, create it by raw and potent Associations, or simply discover the property when seeking out a stronghold? A moot question, perhaps, but thinking briefly on it keeps Mere's mind from turning down a worse path. This mountain, at least, does not actually change itself on a whim. It simply tries to turn intruders aside.

In order to counter that redirection, Mere closes her eyes. She pictures Kella in her mind, and of course the version summoned up is that of the frightened child Mere first discovered trying to warm herself in an abandoned cabin deep within the Aspenwood.

“Lo, child,” Mere says, allowing the spike of pity she feels at the image to soak her voice. “What troubles you so?”

A presence brushes against Mere's aura as if on accident: Kella sensing the address Mere makes, and the reference and offering within it. But the seer in the mountain shies from the address. Shivering, still, in the cold. Mere, eyes still closed, turns towards the brush of Kella's awareness.

Mere could continue to reference their first meeting, but she need not. It's not those steps she needs to trace here. She pushes forward, not trusting her sight or even her sense of context in the space of the mountain. Instead she trusts in Kella.

As Mere leans into the reluctant care of Kella’s Extension, the mountain gale gives one last tug at Mere's coat and hair and aura before it loses its grip. She is inside the mountain now. Though she has been here before and seen firsthand the labyrinthine twists and branching paths of the Caverns of the Seer, there is no time to waste playing games with the incoherence of the mountain. She drives forward, blind and headlong. Dust and small stones crackle underfoot. The chill and sting of the cliffside succumbs to a cozy dry heat. An afterimage of Kella as a child lingers in Mere’s memory. She focuses on shifting it older. It’s not Kella the child she needs to speak with, but Kella the young woman, whose fears eclipse those of her childhood self.

Mere does not let herself think of the welcoming heat and sensation of tightening as the embrace of a place-as-a-being. She does not permit the semblance of a wolf or a sometimes pleasant buzzing to pierce her defenses. Her thumb tightens against the iron ring on her finger. There are doors you must close in your own mind. Seal them up with mortar. Ignore the noises behind them.

Projecting confidence, Mere opens her eyes to the bedchamber of Kella Aspenwood. It’s nothing extravagant: no more than a cavelet nook with a pile of furs as a bed in one corner and a mound of red-hot stones in the other to warm it. Kella sits in the bed, nothing of the shape of their form visible amongst the furs except a round face veiled in a spray of unkempt dark curls that is currently confined around Kella’s head by one of the furs.

Peering out at Mere’s arrival, the seer’s face is tight with futile attempts to suppress fear,  worry, and self-reproach. She says, “He will return, and when he does he will punish us for our insolence.”

Mere says, “Thrast has not yet dared to confront me openly.” She means it to be reassuring.

Kella says, “Nor you him, until today.”

A stab of relief, sharp and hot and quick to drain, to hear that Mere has not lost time to traversing the Bridge. Or at worst, only hours and not days or weeks. She does not hide this from Kella.

Mere says, “With the Circle separated we are blind, and the work is unfinished.”

The seer answers, “I witnessed with you how Lenn’s game with the guardian ended. We were so short-sighted.”

“Yet,” Mere says, “we cannot have missed much. For the moment Thrast is gone from Veneth, and we may yet see it so forevermore. But we must work quickly, and for that we need the bond.”

“It is not nearly finished,” Kella says. “I fear it has scarcely begun. I fear what may be coming. I fear… I fear everything again. The heat won’t touch me. The sun in our sky is imagined. I am not reaching but I can feel the foundations of Veneth quiver at his absence.”

“Kella,” Mere says.

“You could regather the bonds. You are as aligned as I with Extension. I wonder that you feel you need any one of us.”

Mere, blank-faced, reminds Kella, “I am not a god.”

Of course, Kella’s eyes drift pointedly to the pocket where the guise of the Falcon waits. Waits, always, its hunter’s cry an older and more haunting voice than the ones behind the mortared door.

Kella says, “I cannot regather the Circle unless first you answer me a question, and then hear out my fears.”

A small, easily dismissed prick of alarm.

Kella asks, “Who is the boy?”

Mere says, “A surrogate. An innocent.”

“I saw him,” Kella says. They shift in their furs. Uncomfortable? Urgent? “Caught glimpses. Portents of what is coming.”

“A vision?” As she speaks, Mere asks with a gesture and a step if she may join Kella among the furs. A flicker of assent, but the seer shakes their head at the spoken question.

“Too definite. Too uncertain. Wrapped up in the Paradigms themselves. He and… the wizard… are stamped together now and they turn on these moments of shared alignment: 

“The jolt that marks initiation. Stricken by a revenant glare. Emerging from an overwhelming torrent. Snatching for a fading hope. Plunging sword of fatal choice.

“I cannot speak or see them clearer. What comes must end in death, and we sought it out so earnestly.”

Mere holds the prophecy as if on her own tongue, weighing it, tasting it. Despite the resonance of five words eminent, she cannot ring out clarity for what is coming. If it is true prediction, then Kella’s glimpses will prove obvious after the fact. But are they even something she can watch for as whatever is coming unfolds? She discerns something from it, though.

“You think Thrast will return?”

A quiet, wide-eyed nod.

Mere places her hand palm up in the furs. That afterimage, again, of her hand placed that way, on a table. Unthreatening, but asking. “If we are scattered when he returns, he will surely crush us.”

“I cannot hide from him, can I?” Kella’s voice is a whisper, but it echoes lightly in the nook.

“When he realizes what you can do,” Mere says, “he will stop at nothing to be rid of you.”

A single finger curls around one of Mere’s, taut. Kella’s head tries to disappear beneath the furs. She mutters something about being a coward.

Mere gently plucks the corner of a fur and pulls it aside, unveiling Kella to the shoulders. They shiver. Mere says, “You threaten his entire paradigm. Where he takes, you give.”

“But I have nothing but myself.”

Mere snatches her Sparrow into a hug. It startles her, both to think of Kella in those terms and to express it so directly. Perhaps things are now too dire to stifle sentiment. Perhaps the errant gaze of finality rattled something loose. Mere finds herself chuckling into Kella’s hair.

“Child,” she says. “There is more than enough of you to go around.”

It blooms again, that little gleaming ring of connection that is the Circle’s bond. The tether resonates with their thoughts, their intents, and the shaping power of their alignments with the Paradigms.

Kella says, her mouth pressed into Mere’s coat, “Carry it to them again. I cannot cast it so far. And tell Anshall--”

“You’ll tell him yourself,” Mere assures. She brushes a thumb across Kella’s forehead. Then, as a parting, she says, “Thank you for your courage.”

Kella watches Mere go, though it costs her sitting up and the furs dropping away around her, and despite having to do it through tears.
