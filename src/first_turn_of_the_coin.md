# First Turn of the Coin

| David |
|---|

Feeling it coming isn’t enough to prepare David for instant metadimensional transit. There’s no portal to stumble through or stars skewing into relativistic lines. There’s not a waiting room or dial tone, unless that horrible buildup to the piercing of his innermost self counted for that. White fluorescent bathroom lighting blinks out into dim firelight, and the shift in brightness blinds David till his eyes can adjust. The pressure in the tower room is much different from the family bathroom as well, and that is just as jarring. It knocks out his equilibrium, which throws him to the floor and tosses loose one of his earbuds. Somehow, though the stone is rough under his knees and palms and he lands in a drift of some sort of hot flaky powder, it doesn’t hurt when he hits the ground. 

Lila says his name. Maybe he tries to answer. He’s too dissociated to know quite what he’s doing. Someone here moves towards him, also speaking.

David’s mind is anything but empty. It’s a cacophony of half-parsed stimuli and untamed snippets of cognition. He tries to grasp something, physical or internal, that he can use to stagger to his literal or metaphorical feet, but all of his thoughts skitter and buzz about in his skull, harrying his executive function but intangible when he snatches at them.

His eyes finish adjusting. They fix on the fragile glow of embers inches from his face. His fall must have stirred them up. Ashes and a speckling of those embers coat his hands and most of his arms. There’s an earbud-sized crater in a little pile of those ashes that’s not far from his face, and the toe of a boot not two inches from the crater. Everything he sees is haunted by shadows from a torch that flickers above him.

Lila, her voice panicked, asks him what’s happening. David looks up. There’s a man (the one both the torch and the boot belong to) standing threateningly close to where David fell, and he’s holding the headphone that fell out of David’s ear. The man hears Lila’s muffled voice emit from the earbud’s speaker and looks concerned, but not startled. The man’s fist closes around the earbud as if he’s trying to crush it, prompting David to splutter a dazed attempt at a protest.

He hears the engine rev in Lila’s car.

As he hears this David finds something he can crystallize his thoughts around, but he hates it. That heavy line with its anchor in his center is still pulled tight; it’s tugging him towards some untraced direction. Before this time, the pinching dread has always broken into a burn that feels like a flower of fire, or it’s condensed into a fist of ice that drops into his stomach. This time it’s like getting punched through by an arrow on a grappling hook, and now whoever’s on the other end is trying to haul him in. Those other times he’s at least had the relief that it’s over, and all that’s left to deal with is the aftermath, however painful. Now, though, he’s certain that whatever terrible thing (or string of them) had been coming isn’t finished yet. He begs his stupid, hateful mess of a brain for something else to latch onto. Couldn’t his sister’s voice, a sense of justice, or blunt curiosity galvanize him instead? But no, in the sizzling haze of his mind there’s only this: It’s going to get worse. Fine. He snatches hold of that thought and climbs on top of it. He takes a breath, and *thank God* his brain lets him pay some attention to his surroundings.

He’s in a stone room with a man and a woman who look almost confused as he feels. This room is doorless, windowless, and empty except two distinct piles of ashes and the three of them close enough to huddle up together. David is kneeling in one of the ash mounds, the water from his brush sizzling in a residual heat he feels as if from a distance. It’s hot, but like a good shower hot. Not enough to hurt. The man with the torch opens his fist to frown at David’s earbud, which is somehow intact.

Lila says, "Stay on the line as long as you can. I'm coming."

The woman moves while the man is distracted, holding out a hand as if to calm the two of them. The man takes one precise step back.  To David the woman looks, like, 39. She’s wearing a short dark brown coat and slacks, both swarming with buttoned pockets (some of which are bulging). Her gesture draws David’s eyes to the mask she holds in her warning hand: a full-face red falcon mask fashioned from feathers and polished wood. She holds the mask with two fingers at one bottom corner, her fingers poised with a care that suggests the mask is both precious to her and somehow more violent to carry than the sword in her other hand. She holds that sword at her side in a loose grip. It’s covered in gold decoration. Her hair’s in a crown braid; her posture implies an actual crown would belong just fine.

She says, “I did not expect this.”

David tries to think of something he can say that would also give his sister some context. Even now after he’s wrestled his way to attention his thoughts flow thick as syrup. David doesn’t try to care about first impressions, but his body reacts in anticipation to making a first impression the way it would to a threat to his life. A ripple under his abiding anticipation of disaster is that he’s already made himself look like an idiot. But there’s no escaping it now, and at least they aren’t laughing at him.

He settles, finally, on the cringe-inducing all-timer, “Where am I?” But it comes out as a croak, and he’s not sure either Lila or the two in the room with him understand the question. Is it too hot in the room, or is the humidity difference between home and here so great it’s screwing with his throat?

The man with the torch[^1] is in uniform, something white and pristine, but the thing he’s holding that seemed like a torch at first is burning all the way down to an oval-shaped cross-guard.  So not a torch; it’s a sword that’s on fire. That tracks with the ash heaps. The sword-flames are the only source of light in the room.

Forgetting the headphone now that David has spoken, the man now stares at David like you watch the road for deer after one darts in front of your car. Then the man’s face sinks fractionally. His eyes flick down. They tag the woman before fixing on David again to be sure he hasn’t moved. He says, “I don’t feel him.” His voice, urgent, hitches when he says “him.” It doesn’t sound like he’s talking about David. “The Circle?”

She says, “The bonds are just scattered.”

“And this lad?” The man gestures with his firebrand. Since there’s no other light in this room, the way the light shifts with the gesture feels a little like a floodlight pinpointing David. It’s that gesture that cements in David’s mind that this guy is a cop. Officer Firesword it is.

She doesn’t answer Firesword. Instead she disappears that falcon mask into one of her countless pockets, then leans the tip of her sword into the stone and lowers herself to her knees in front of David. Her head is frighteningly close to the flames of the soldier’s weapon, and that makes half her face disappear into shadows.

She asks, “Are you well?”

Looking into that half face, drawn with somber lines of flickering orange-red light, reinforces David’s conclusion that the worst is still coming. It has to be worse that she’s being so careful and tense, right? As he reels with that, David’s tongue stays locked behind his teeth.

Lila is talking in the earbud again. “Who is that?” she asks. “Is someone taking you somewhere? Please, get me some details!” She’s not waiting long enough for him to find a way to answer, and Firesword glances again at the headphone he’s still holding. David draws another deep breath of smoky air. It doesn’t make him feel like he has to cough, but he coughs anyway. Then he slides his phone out of his pocket to change the call settings from his earbuds to speakerphone.

The growl from Lila’s laboring engine bursts into the chamber from the phone’s speaker.

The woman blinks. The firelight bobs as Firesword tries to gesture for the woman to stand up and back away from David. David watches them, unblinking, thinking. Almost absently, he sets his phone on the floor in front of him, plucks out the earbud that was still in his ear, and tucks it away in its case.

The man says, “What are these instruments?” He waggles the headphone between his fingers and then gestures with the same hand towards the phone and the case David just put in his pocket. “Where are those sounds coming from?”

Can he say something bold and clever enough? Does it matter if they know for sure that he’s connected to someone far away (maybe even worlds away)? Lila’s going to think she can still help him unless he can convince her that he’s been whisked somewhere impossible for her to reach. But he doesn’t know if he can put the words for that together fast enough to say them before the situation sweeps past his chance to affect it.

“David?” Lila asks, this time her voice ringing fully into the chamber.

“It’s–” David’s voice creaks, so he clears his throat and tries again. “That’s my sister.”

Something clicks for Officer Firesword. He mutters, “Ambergris.” A curse, the way he says it. He looks to the woman, who shakes her head.

“I would know if he had stolen the Circle’s bonds. This is something else.”

“But it is similar.” Firesword sounds like he’s driving at something else. Looking for some terrible confirmation.

The woman seems to steel herself. She looks David in the eyes again and says, “I am called Mere. Please… David?” She pauses to see his nod confirm the name. “I’m so sorry, David, but please, if you can answer me this: are there many people in the land you and your sister are from?”

Lila’s voice is a whipcrack, “Why?”

Firesword curses again.

“Unless we are swift,” Mere answers, “they are all doomed.”

David squeezes his eyes shut.

“Doomed by what?” Lila asks.

He doesn’t see what Mere and Officer Firesword do, but they’re quiet. It feels like they’re watching him. Expecting him to respond to Mere’s pressure.

Lila doesn’t wait for David. She says, “What. Did. You. Do.”

But it’s still quiet after, and Lila is going to get nowhere with them like this. Swimming through the turmoil of his mind, the only thing he finds to cling to is still that one punctured pillar binding him to the Worse that’s coming. David makes what he concludes to be his only choice, to the mild shock and utter heartbreak of those who witness it. He opens his eyes and stands (leaving the toilet brush in the ashes, but not his phone) and shakily says, “Okay. What do you need me to do?”

Mere stands with him. The shock, and the new fault line it leaves in its wake, she quickly spackles over with the blank of business. She says, “Come with me,” and turns away.

“I’d ask where,” David says, “but I don’t see how it would make a difference.”

“David!” Lila hisses. “What are you doing? Don’t go anywhere with them!”

He holds the phone up near his mouth and whispers, “I’m somewhere else already, Li.” He taps the button to shift the call to video. The phone pulses in his hand. There’s a quick pop-up that reads: *Video calling is currently unavailable*.

As they’re talking, Mere draws a line with the tip of her sword on one wall of the room. A door appears within the border of that line. It must stand almost ten feet from the floor to the ceiling, and it is formed entirely from a dark and glossy wood. Where the handle should be, there is a large gilded keyhole. David records a video of the whole process, murmuring his commentary to Lila.

The man with the burning sword says, “I would also like to know where we are going.”

“I had thought you would guess,” Mere says, sliding her sword into the door’s keyhole. It goes in up to the hilt, which in turn now looks like an overly long doorknob.

The man says, “I want to hear it.”

Mere turns the hilt-knob. “I’d like to consult your husband.”

The door creaks open.  The man asks, “Is that wise?”

“The boy is bound for the Sword regardless.”

“Hey!” Lila’s voice peaks the speaker. “Don’t touch my brother!”

The man with the burning sword cocks his head at David. His brow creases. “Is she in the same place you were in before you arrived here?”

David says no, but she’s on her way.

The man says, “Warn her off.”

Mere looks between them, her arm still outstretched to hold a partially open portal to yet another elsewhere.

David takes a few steps to get a better angle at the opening the door just made in the room, but Officer Firesword stays on him, and the light from the sword obscures what might be beyond.

David asks, “Do we have time for questions?”

Mere answers, “On the way.”

She starts to finish pulling the door open, but the man says, “Wait. I cannot tolerate it.”

Mere waits.

Firesword aims his voice towards David’s phone. “Do not go to where your brother was before. I believe a creature has taken his place, a man of fogged vision, unbending will, and hideous strength. If you encounter this man, he will unmake you.”

“Sworn Sword,” Mere says, voice heavy with regret. “We do not have time.” 

And she hauls the door open, showing David that the space beyond is black.  David’s first thought is that it’s night on the other side, but as he and Firesword approach the doorway it becomes clear that instead it’s a huge stone bridge in an endless teetering void. A short set of stairs connects their door to that bridge. Visible across the bridge is another set of stairs leading to a different door, glimmering and translucent.

Officer Firesword says, “Something is wrong.”

“I agree this permutation is ominous,” Mere says, “but Lenn awaits with our answers.”

With a curt nod and no further complaint, the officer moves to usher David through the door after Mere.

David asks, “What’s wrong with the Bridge?” They don’t answer.

He follows Mere across the threshold. As he does, static hisses out of his phone’s speakers.

“David, I think I’m losing—”

The call drops. She’s gone. It happens in the same moment that Firesword’s namesake winks out.

David loses his balance again immediately. There’s no hand-rail on the steps leading down to the bridge, which seems like a great way to leave you a clumsy step away from an eternal fall into the nothing. David almost does just that, except that Firesword claps a hand on David’s shoulder to steady him.

When David turns his head and looks up the bridge (or down it, how could you tell?) his eyes water. He locks his gaze on Mere’s back instead. After the man with the until-recently-burning sword passes through the doorway, it closes out of existence. They feel it close, each imagining the soft click and the change in pressure, but as quickly as the resonance of the moment strikes it passes over them.

Firesword is dead-quiet. Not just non-verbal: his steps, breath, and clothing make no sound. His sword isn’t even burning anymore.

David tries to keep his eyes fixed on Mere. She’s two strides ahead, moving with the confidence of a captain walking the deck of her ship during a battle or a storm. There’s tension there, but it’s worn down into a kind of comfort. Here on this bridge, which draws David’s mind out to lengths beyond sight and whose very existence sets David on edge, Mere is home. He tries to keep focused on that, but the weight of the bridge laid out in front of them draws his eyes up.

That hook, line, and sinking feeling which his sense of impending doom has become is aligned with the direction of the bridge. It tightens further as if in response to his noticing, to the point it feels like he’ll be yanked off his feet any moment and go plummeting towards whatever waits at the end of the Bridge.

The hand on David’s shoulder tightens, but the sensation is strange. It’s like it’s Firesword’s fingers that give, the way David imagines what stone would feel when someone pushes on it, if a stone could feel.

David tries to draw a breath to speak, and realizes then that he cannot suck air into his lungs--that there is no air here for him to breathe--yet his intended words seem to sound even while his mouth is startled frozen. Those words ring in the abyssal dark around the bridge, *“I was going to ask questions.”* Struck by the strange sensation, he tries to force a chuckle, but there isn’t even the shadow of laughter to escape him.

He says, *“Dear God there’s no air in here how am I talking scratch that how are my lungs not exploding what is this place and why is it so hollow?”*

*“This is a Realm of Extension,”* Mere says. *“It is shaped by the thoughts and wills of those who walk its path. Everything but the path itself is transient, here.”*

David means to say, “Oh,” but the thought that niggles in his mind in response is what sounds instead, *“But there’s* nothing *here except the path. And these doors.”*

As they continue, David takes note of the doors. There is a door of earthen reddish wood with brass ring handles, a gray fence-gate shrouded in fog, a once-broken iron door whose cracks are filled with gold, an open arch of flowers, and, for just a moment, a plain off-white door with something nailed to its face. When he tries to look closer at any of them, but especially the last one, the doors have vanished like they were never there.

Finally, Mere answers, *“There is some will suppressing the way that the realms normally mingle at the edges here. I trust it is not you, Sworn Sword?”*

The flavor of Firesword’s shifting, uncomfortable silence is that it is not him forcing the Bridge into a strangling, nihilistic blackness. He was the one of the two of them to point out that something was wrong, anyway. So why would Mere ask, unless it’s to make David wonder?

But David latches onto something else. *“That’s not your name, is it? Sworn Sword?”* He finds he prefers the strange nature of speech over crushing silence.

*“It is a title: I am the Sworn Sword, an Arbiter of Ea’river.”*

*“I don’t think I can call you by a title. Can we do names? Mine is David. I’m from Earth, the place that her majesty just admitted is imminently doomed. You?”*

The guy doesn’t answer.

*“Doesn’t have to be your real name,”* David says.

Still nothing.

*“Fine, I’m calling you Mustang.”* Both a little more and a little less on the nose than Firesword, David figures. Having taken that sip of levity, he gets back to the real questions. *“Why is my planet doomed?”*

An old cabin door, several of its planks shattered and the whole thing snapped off its hinges, passes them in the dark.

After Mustang pauses too long again, it’s Mere that answers. *“A man is strangling Veneth,”* she says. *“We undertook to dispel him from this realm with a curse. Though he seems to have been expelled, there appears to be one more step required to seal his exile.”*

*“I appeared where he disappeared, so you think he will be in my place?”*

*“Until we complete the curse,”* Mere says.

David thinks of his parents, safe at a retreat, and of his sister, probably ignoring Mustang’s warning and racing home for a date with a world-ending horror. He says, *“How do we do that?”*

*“I have a suspicion,”* Mere answers, *“but I want to confirm it with Lenn.”*

*“Is that Mustang’s estranged husband?”*

Mustang’s fingers flex against David’s shoulder again. There is the ghost of pressure in it, but only to a point. David detects it more from the guy’s shift in posture than anything his shoulder feels. He wonders if his arm has gone numb, and turns to see Mustang’s scowl.

Mustang is the picture of a stone-faced stoic. Except, he’s not the kind of stoic who has naturally stunted emotions and expressions. He’s one of the actual philosophical ones, one like David sometimes thinks he’d like to be, if he could master his own facial expressions. So Mustang has big tells peeking through that attempt at dour and statuesque. Firelight that isn’t there anymore seems to dance in his eyes, painting passion plays of dread, worry, loss, and regret. 

*All right there, my guy,* David thinks. *I see you. I get it.*

Mere says, *“Lenn drew out the terms for the curse. He will best know how we need to proceed.”*

*“Where does this Bridge lead?”* David asks.

Mustang says, *“Its end.”*

Mere says, *“To wherever one is headed, with some exceptions.”*

*“So I could find my way home from here?”*

*“If you knew where to look.”*

The stone feels like it turns beneath David’s feet. He turns his head with the sensation, and swears that for a hot second he can see that white door again, the one with a poster on it, atop a set of carpeted stairs that have branched from the Bridge. When he looks closer for it, though, there’s nothing.

David asks, *“Will you tell me how?”*

*“There isn’t time.”*

*“Looks like a long walk.”*

Mere pauses. *“There is no time* here.”

David says, *“Uh.”*

*“I said this is a realm of Extension. This is not a place the way the tower was. What illusions of flesh and presence you experience here are projections. When the thought of our passage is completed, so too will our arrival complete.”*

*“I… what? If we get there ‘when’ we get there, don’t we have as much space for conversation as it takes?”*

*“You are already wandering dangerously,”* Mere says. *“Say you are drawing an arrow in the sand on a beach. You have in mind to what the arrow should point, but you allow yourself to be distracted by an unusually large wave or the sounding of a gull. Your line not only wavers, but the arrow gestures askew, towards some other object you know not what, and the thought you meant to share is lost even before the tide can clear it from the sands.*

*“I will not be diverted from the course, so while I have permitted your questions so far I cannot stop to teach you all the wonder and peril of pathfinding the realms.”*

On queue for the end of that statement, David spots a shape in the distance: the outline of an enormous burning sword.

[^1]: Also, like, 39-ish, or maybe just a seen-some-shit 33.
