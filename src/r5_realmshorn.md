# Realmshorn

There is an order to these things. Like the curse cast upon Thrast, establishing the Circle’s bond is a ritual with steps. Reality itself follows the order sometimes--always--never quite, depending on the angle. Association: the birth of an idea, the thought before you’ve had it, the spark of will. Extension: the reach for connection, the plan laid out unexecuted. These Mere has regathered into the Circle in herself and Kella, but the others remain. The hardest, unfortunately, is next.

Domination: the plan in practice, the will ascendant. Lenn, drifting between realms without a tether to any of them, an exile from belonging itself, is the next step in their ritual of re-binding the Circle. To reach him will take patience. To reach him without losing far too much time on Veneth will take astounding luck or the intervention of fate. 

Mere returns to the Bridge. Whatever presence had previously shifted the realm’s aspect has faded, so the dark and silence that surrounded it is now packed in with whatever contexts the nearby doors bear with them. A half dozen little pleading gates appear that would return her to Veneth. Two doors meander in from neighboring Realms. The ghost of another flickers, though it must be only in her mind, because it dare not risk her attention or the oaths of the Iron Ring.

Going with her gut and the subtle thrust of her shared Extension with Kella, Mere turns her attention to one of the two doors that have presented themselves from outside Veneth. This one is small, shadowed, and susurrating. It is one of the more challenging Realms for her to tolerate on its face, but still safe by comparison. She thumbs the Iron ring and plunges into the darkness. It is not the darkness of the Seer’s cavelet, or the void that recently surrounded the bridge. This is a third darkness, that of a place where all that exists is sound.

It is said that the Whispering Void was once a Realm only of splendid music, an eternal chorus creating beauty without the need for other purpose. This has changed. Maybe somewhere in the void there is a pocket of the old songs, but now the Realm is filled with a dreadful silence constantly encroached upon by sibilant whispers worse than the silence itself. Mere enters into this silence as another voice, louder and clearer than the resident voices.

“Lenn,” she says, her physicality folded into the sound. It resonates at once like the single syllable of his name and the whole statement of her purpose. *I call you, Lenn, to trade words with me*.

He does eventually come, but not before the whispering voices who fill the void begin to take up her call. They repeat it until it becomes a low and insistent song filling the silence. Waves of it wash over her, carrying endless permutations of inflection that twist her meaning back on her by peeling free shades of desperation and longing and fear and even anger. Though it’s clear they are turning it back on her, it somehow never seems to betray the original note: a grating symphony made by a spoken word dissected, revivified, and laid out again endlessly.

Other voices don’t take up the song and instead respond to her call by trying to cajole and propose and insinuate their way past her defenses and out of the void to Realms less barren. They seem to sense within her what is kept beyond their reach by a banded hum of ringing Iron that the Ring becomes in this place.  There’s no escaping them without drawing more attention to herself or departing the realm entirely. All she can do is to endure as they reach past barriers of will that are less than illusory here.

*They could never reach it*, Kella’s voice tells her, a thought they have read in Mere’s own heart and brought forth as an assurance. The seer pulls that piece of Mere away like a parent lifting a misused toy above the grasping hands of a petulant child.

Then comes Lenn, and unlike Mere and the residents of the void he appears as himself, not a disembodied voice but a fully visible and tactile man. His condition mocks the realm’s own structure. He is accustomed to this by now, as Mere is, but there still seems to be an itch between his shoulders that he refuses to scratch.

No more than a few years prior to Mere’s acquaintance with them, Persaval’s Separation severed Lenn’s Association with the Realm of Veneth herself. Unable or unwilling to bind himself to a new home, Lenn now drifts from Realm to Realm, traveling more freely even than Mere ever could--except that he can never go home, because *home does not recognize him*. But the ties between those who bear unforsaken oaths to each other are not so easily severed. It is by Lenn and Persaval’s dedication to each other that Lenn can be bound to the Circle at all. Even that is not sufficient to return him from exile: a reminder to Mere not to underestimate either the deviousness of Thrast or the scale of Persaval’s Separation.

Lenn positions himself as if kneeling down to brush the petals of a flower, and says to Mere, “Do you need to be so loud every time you come to this place?”

“It bothers me,” Mere says.

Whispers creep into Lenn’s silence.

“There is a boy,” she explains. “It seems he is the surrogate we didn’t anticipate.”

“Were you looking for confirmation?”

“*Questions*, Lenn.”

“Sorry.” He settles from his kneeling position into sitting cross-legged. “I Commanded reality to produce us someone who would choose to bear this burden for us. Declarations are sour on my tongue at the moment.”

“We’re trusting you on this.” The whispers run away with those five words, flaying surface meaning into a little storm of connotation.

Something to note about Lenn and Domination: he gives himself time. He takes it now, absorbing what Mere says and how the Realm reacts. To watch his face as he does makes Mere keenly aware that she is doing it without a face of her own. 

“I broke the Circle,” he says, and this time she feels the honed edge of his words glistening near his own skin. Was that a product of the Void, or his Domination? “Is P—I hope everyone is well.”

“I met with Kella,” Mere says. “Not broken, just scattered. If you are ready…”

Lenn holds up a hand to stop her words. “Tell me of the boy.”

Mere doesn’t want to hesitate. The whispers abhor a contemplative silence. Worse, they echo Lenn’s request as a demand, as instruction. Somewhere in the distance, one of the voices starts screaming. She hesitates anyway. How much did she have the chance to learn of the boy before she sent him away? That he was startlingly quick to do what was required? That the Realm he came from was defenseless against the likes of Thrast? That he had a sister with a sharp tongue? That the boy was as strongly aligned with at least one Paradigm as she had witnessed in anyone, yet she could not say for certain if one of them held a stronger sway?

Mere says “I left him with Persaval.”

Lenn cracks a sad smile.

“What a pair we make,” he says. “You did not brave the whispers just to snap my link back onto the chain.”

“What if I did, Lenn? Do not pretend the Circle means nothing to you. His first thought was of you.”

He answers that so quietly that the whispers still, but his voice is warm, “Don’t lie. His first thought was to make sure the boy wasn’t Thrast in a new guise.”

“You deserve to feel each other again.”

Lenn’s face tightens. For a brief moment, voices begin to take up her words again, but then the Realm of Whispers hushes, except for that one voice that is still screaming. An unspoken stricture from the Realmshorn will not permit them to torment him in that way.

He says, “Mere, what is his name?”

She cannot bring herself to answer.

Lenn says, “You’ve come to me unsure. Are you second-guessing what it will take to fulfill the curse?”

She whispers, “Questions, Lenn…”

He regards her, and she cannot read whether he is cold as ice or restraining himself. That itch between his shoulders seems to have grown.

He starts to read her. His tone becomes pressing. “You’ve spoken with the seer already, and you have a sovereign to assure when we’re done here. Can you do it all in time? What could go wrong if your steps are off?

“And isn’t that the problem we’re wrestling with here? We found the steps were off. It wasn’t what we thought. Better to be sure, right? And who better to assure you that it doesn’t have to cost what you fear than the man who answered the question that dropped the boy in your lap?”

“Yes!” Mere all but shrieks. “All of that! Why are you so set on dragging it out of me?”

“It is no more cruel than your *being kind* about my husband, Falcon.”

Now she is sure that Lenn is in a cold fury. She has a will like iron. *She* spoke the sealing words of the curse for Thrast. Yet here is this man, banished from belonging itself, treating her like a child at lessons. This man who can cow an entire division of reality with the tightening of his jaw.

“It must be absolutely clear,” Lenn says. “We are talking about whether we must consign a boy who is scarcely more than a child to ignominious death. The thought is *chilling*. We thought we were prepared for stakes like this. We must own that mistake. But there is one thing we must center most, now that we are in this situation:

“We cannot dictate the outcome. We can make our best choices, we can shine and burn and defy Thrast’s horrible, destructive folly. But we cannot be Thrast. What is the boy’s name?”

Mere says, “David.”

“It must be David’s choice. Whatever comes, when David stands before that angel, he *shall not be forced into the choice he makes*.”

“And if he chooses wrong?”

Lenn reaches out his hand as if for her to take it.

Mere meets his extended hand with Association and the binding of the Circle, and the confidence and direction of the Realmshorn returns to the Circle.

Earnest as an oath, he admits, “I yearn for my husband.”
