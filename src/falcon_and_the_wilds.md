# The Falcon and the Wilds

| Flashback |

They welcomed Mere when she returned to the Court of the Gods without her mentor. It was a frosty welcome, but they fed her again the fruit of those trees and under the glittering boughs they proclaimed her the Falcon Goddess of Messengers. Then the gods began to hand her assignments with stiff hands. They were always tasks that would take her a long time to complete: maintenance of the Marshalls’ Gates, strings of correspondence to various state powers to be delivered by hand on specific dates spanning weeks or months, or observing and reporting on the state of the Golethan fleets.

She understood that the gods of Naris sought to keep her out in the world and not at court. They never asked her opinion on a matter or offered more than a cursory update on the state of her nation. Because their faces were always behind their masks of office and she rarely had the time to linger, it was impossible for her to read a hint of fear or sorrow in their dispositions. They seemed disdainful. Self-occupied. So, reading it as a sort of dismissal, Mere took to behaving as if it were one. She carved her own meandering paths across Veneth.

One such path led to her walking along the bank of a wide river, watching the gold of the sun catch fire as it fell into the forest beyond the river, where the day would be swallowed by night. In walking she happened on a village. There was one impressive established building made from a combination of brick and lumber that stood over a narrower band of the river and sported a large wooden wheel turning over steadily in the flow of the current. The rest of the village might have been mistaken for a ruin, because many of the smaller homes were half-built. This was not a part of Veneth she had associated with a map, so Mere had no way of knowing where they had come from without stopping in to meet the residents.

At the sight of a woman with her face behind a red-lacquered mask of a falcon, the adults who were busy at work erecting their homes scarcely paused to acknowledge her presence. But a girl who had been crouching against a stone polishing something with a rag approached Mere. Without saying anything at first, the child raised a chunk of polished amber to her eye and viewed Mere through it. It caught the sun as it lifted, straining Mere’s eyes briefly with a flare of golden light.

Mere said, “Good evening.”

“Departure,” the girl answered.

As Mere stepped closer and knelt down to the girl’s eye level, the girl continued to track her with the amber, like a lens. Mere said, “Are you asking me to leave?”

“No.” The girl smiled. She dropped her hand and the amber to her side but continued to peer at Mere appraisingly. "Did you come ea’-river?”

“Did I what?”

The girl gestured towards the woods. “You come from the woods cross-river or from ea’?”

“From the east?”

The girl kept smiling. “I like your bird mask.”

“I like your amber.”

The girl said, “It’s not mine. Have to give it back.”

“Back to whom?”

The child points out into the woods across the river without turning her eyes off of Mere. Mere followed the finger, peering out toward the setting sun and a growing shadow in the woods. She jumped before she could discern why. It was a shock, like she had noticed something alarming in the sight of the woods, but she could not place exactly what until she’d taken that first startled breath.

Looking out into those woods felt like staring into an unlit cavern. It felt like the kind of unnerving sight she had turned her back on at the Temple of Answered Questions on the edge of the Wilds. Unbidden, her aura flared, and her face flushed.

Mere muttered, “Did the Wilds move again?”

They had been static for years now, forming that cliff face that overlooked the Sea of Goletha.

The girl peeked at Mere through the amber again. She said, “And return.”

Mere’s eyes drifted to the glittering stone.

“Here.” The girl handed the amber chunk to Mere.

As the stone passed inside the expanded burn of her aura, Mere felt the unplaceable hum that marked this chunk of amber as was what her predecessor had often defined an Object: a thing of Association, a fragment of the soul of a person or a group of people cultivated within a piece of the world, like the Officiant Masks of the Gods of Naris or the Gilded Sword.

She said, “This stone is very special.”

The child shrugged. 

With the amber in her grasp, it was not difficult for Mere to discern its effect. When she looked into its depths, she could see a starstruck night with a gibbous moon like a leering grin. She heard the distant howl of a wolf. A drop of succulent honey seemed to tease her tongue.

The girl told her, “Amber shares what it remembers.”

A sensation of nascent warmth swept over Mere. A skein of comfort, of layers of dark shelter within a greater whole that provided everything she needed to--Mere dropped the amber back into the girl’s hand as if it had stung her.

She stood up, her aura still burning out around her. The aura took in the girl, the unfinished corner of this village they were in. Her fingers tingled. The howl still sounded in her ears. There was some strange quality to the child, Mere thought, but as her aura stretched out she knew that was wrong. The quality was in the air, in this place. Amber waited beneath her feet. It drifted in the river. Dozens of small well-loved chunks were kept close by the people building their new village.

“My Ma says ‘atimes what it remembers is going away, and ‘atimes it’s coming back. Departure and return.”

The amber wanted to share something with Mere. A new memory. Those scattered pieces dragged on the part of her soul that was bound to Mother Veneth, and rolled out Mere’s aura like a blanket over a massive, fertile river delta. In the clay lay tons of amber, a trove of history lost to time or… not yet remembered.

“Miss?” the girl asked, tugging on Mere’s hand.

The amber heart of Veneth showed her the Falcon, her mentor, cutting the cord that bound Thrast to his mother with the Gilded Sword. It echoed that dire proclamation. It held her on the edge of that cliff to dangle over the ever-raging sea. Standing on the deck of a Golethan ship, unperturbed by the storm and peering up hundreds of feet and across memory itself, was a boy, not yet ten. He met her eyes.

In a crack like thunder that was joined with a flash of fire at Mere’s feet, her aura snapped back tight around her. She collapsed beside the little girl with the amber. Where she fell she lay looking across from east of the river at the woods. At the setting sun. At the Wilds.
