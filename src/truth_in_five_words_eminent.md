# Truth in Five Words Eminent

| Persaval |
| :---: |

The homestead Persaval and his husband Lenn had made together sat atop a raised plot of ground in the middle of a plain like an island amidst a sea of grass. It bathed often in golden sunlight. A small wood stood not far to the west, dwarfed by the Great River that had long ago named first a settlement, then a city, and eventually a nation. There was a taste to the wind here, a little sage sweetness. Here in Ea’river they called it “amber on the wind,” claiming that the sun had gilded the winds over the generations the way it had gilded the nation’s sacred History Stones. Persaval stood within their home, breathing deeply of the amber-breeze, and contently prepared the vegetables for their evening meal.

The cabin itself was small, humble by design. It had a single room, with a stove and counter in one corner, a bed in another, and a little lacquered table that stood a few inches off the floor in the center. Their storehouse was actually bigger. If you knew what you sought you could spot its low stone arch from the doorway. Below were their food stores, weapons, and other needed supplies. That left the cabin to be the warm embrace that it was: sanded wood and river stone; shelves bore fired-clay cups and bowls above the counter; more shelves just above head height held selected facets of amber in careful settings. Here, Persaval and Lenn had situated a peace that had been carefully built and then blissfully maintained.

Elsewhere’s turbulence didn’t reach here.

“Here’s a conversation worth having,” Lenn said as he brought in a wrap of cutlets from their storehouse. There was still blood on the cloth, so this must have been from a recent kill. Persaval sensed that Lenn was carrying something else in with the meat, a faint burn of Association that he would not have noticed if it wasn’t from his husband. Was this something Lenn had been dwelling on while out hunting? Longer than that? Lenn kept on, as always implacably in-the-moment. He reached out to shake the bowl of vegetables Persaval had been filling. The slices settled, leaving Persaval more room to work. Lenn didn’t need to confirm that he had Persaval’s attention. When didn’t he have it? “What do the Wilds mean?”

Persaval set out one last root, spun, and lit their stove by flicking out a spark of his aura, temporarily held separate and sustained by walls of Separation, to flicker into a flame that could only radiate heat up onto the surface of the pan above it as he directed. It was a practiced application of his Paradigms, rote after years learning to harness what the paths of reality afforded him, but there was something in the rhythm of Lenn’s entrance, in the Association he’d brought inside, that made Persaval take note of the particulars of the moment. He did so with something not quite reaching concern. This was unusual, but it didn’t feel like it was misaligned to the aura of warmth they had cultivated in this place, *their* place.

While he took note of this, Persaval asked, “The Wilds?”

Lenn unwrapped the cuts of meat and tumbled them into the pan in perfect rhythm. He said, “Without them, life would seem almost too neat. We would have the near-perfect illusion of control, could expect that life will persist the way we’ve imagined it will. But the Wilds won't let us forget that all of our boundaries are lines drawn on a shore, and the Wilds are the tide.”

As Lenn finished saying this, Persaval stepped close to add the finished vegetables to the meat in the pan. He snatched a pinch of herb and spice to dash on all of it. Then he wrapped an arm around Lenn.

Persaval said, “Some direction, oh artful Questioner? Is this topic political or paradigmatic at heart?”

Lenn leaned into him. Warmth. He said, “This conversation is about structure.”

Persaval peeled his eyes from Lenn’s and turned some of his attention to stirring the frying ingredients of their dinner. Invisible divisions manifested in the pan, new barriers that conformed to the shape of the pan while pushing and turning vegetables and cutlets of venison to keep everything cooking evenly but not burning. He could use Separation to slice straight through the pan if that was what he wanted, but why would he want to? “In what way is this about structure? That it is fleeting? Tenuous?”

Lenn watched the pan stir itself. His fingers traced unseen lines up Persaval’s arm. “That it’s limited by definition. We see for ourselves how forces often move outside those limits in ways beyond our ken.” He paused to snatch up a cutlet of venison that had scarcely taken on a sear. He popped it into his mouth, smiling softly around it as he chewed. “They are *indifferent* to our limits.”

“So Veneth is a pan of stir fry.”

Lenn shrugged.

“Structure is meaningless, then?” A question compelled by the line of Lenn’s argument. Persaval thought he could see where Lenn was going with this, but he preferred to hear it in his husband’s words. Everyone else was so careful how they spoke around the infamous champion of the Game of Questions, lest they be manipulated by a master of Domination into a realignment of their entire existence. They missed so much, fearing that result. So much of Lenn’s personality was genuine invitation, and so much of his perspective was shaped by being aligned with a Paradigm like Domination. That had to be a mighty weight. Knowing that, Persaval counted it a joy to let Lenn be himself.

And Lenn proceeded to. “Count your words, my husband.” Four. Lenn stepped away from the pan, but gave Persaval’s arm a squeeze as he pulled free. He set a couple smaller bowls at their table on the floor. “Rituals: When we take five words to say a thing, the thing we’ve said resounds with truth. Why? Because there are five Paradigms? Just by chance? Why does a Game of Questions work the way it does to skew the scales of power? Why do the lanterns of the Gentlefishers calm the storm around their ships? There are always new and surprising rules to discover about how the world works. Are they rules because we found them and called them rules? Did we weave them into existence, or are they immutable truths? Anyone can purposefully break the rule of the Truth In Five Words Eminent just by knowing it exists and deciding to be contrary. Does that make it useless to observe the ritual?”

Persaval looked up from the pan. He gave Lenn a long, quiet smile. “It’s ready.” He snuffed out the flame on the stove as easily as Lenn had plucked out the bite of meat: he dropped the barriers of Separation that held the flake of his aura in place and it drifted back into his soul like a scattered ember that cooled and fell back into the fire.

“Look at that,” Lenn said, grinning as he gingerly moved the pan to their table on the floor. “I can smell the resherb.”

Persaval cocked his head at his husband. “You haven’t reached your point,” he said. But he settled down cross-legged across from Lenn, nostrils full of the scent of their dinner.

“My point,” Lenn said, using a spoon to dole out some stir fry into the bowls for the two of them, “is that the purpose of structure, of ritual, law, or recipe, is not to set One True Definition of Reality, or to know and control something just to *have control*. It’s to make a meal.”

| David |
| :---: |

That big red door is gone the moment Mustang follows David through. It’s only then that he releases David’s shoulder and even then after letting David stagger forward and savor the sensation of breathing again, the guy’s protective posture doesn’t seem to drop.

They’re standing on the stones of some sort of overgrown courtyard which is slowly being swallowed by weeds, moss, wildflowers, and the layers of soil the plants sprang from and became. It was huge, once. Parking lot-sized. The bricks of the courtyard themselves are the size of small parking spaces. Behind where David and Persaval came out there’s a half-collapsed arch that would have cast its shadow across them if the sky wasn’t so gloomy. The stones of that arch catch David’s attention, because there are symbols across the face of the portion that’s still standing and also carved into the stones around the base of it. The courtyard ends at that arch, so that the hook shape of the broken arch frames a few miles of unbroken tall grass. 

Even though half the arch is spilled out into that grass, the crown of the arch somehow stands free. That central stone’s carving is of a sword with the tip pointed down, ready to plunge straight through the symbol on the stone of the courtyard directly beneath it. Seeing that, David feels his anchor-line pull tight like it had on the Bridge, and it comes with an imagined blast of heat and the feeling of being watched.

Buzzing. Panic.

A gust and the scent it carries pulls him out of it. Off to what he guesses is the North there’s an ocean that devoured the horizon a long time ago, but the horizon must have given it indigestion. A dozen dark gray stormclouds are stacking themselves into a tower out over that ocean, halfway towards the horizon. Lightning cracks within the growing storm, and the thunder that follows is distant but still rattles his chest. The way the storm has gathered, blocking a view of the horizon, feels in the moment like watching a bear standing up to loom over a kill.

“The Sea of Goletha,” Mustang says. “There is always a storm on its waters.”

David slips his phone from his pocket and records a video. He checks for notifications and service while he does it. Nothing. But the battery life indicator is missing. He feels… blank. It raises the itch to fish out his earbuds and play some music, but—

“Can I have my ear bud back?” he asks.

Mustang pulls from a pocket and opens his hand. Such a look races across his face that David is surprised the guy doesn’t drop what he’s holding like a live coal. Well, given he regularly sets his sword on fire, maybe this is exactly how he would react to a live coal.

For a moment, David glimpses what's surprised Officer Firesword: instead of a little headphone-what-you-put-in-your-ear, there’s a tiny chunk of amber. Then the moment passes and it resolves into the object it’s supposed to be. David plucks the earbud out of Mustang’s hand.

He surprises himself by tucking it into its case with its twin. Then he says, “It’s clear that we’re both back-footed here. Do we have time to unpack, or are you gonna rush me off to another trauma event?”

Mustang continues to stare at his hand. “All I require is you stay close.” It’s muttered, distracted. 

With the sense of urgency deflated, it’s hard to think of what to ask first. Harder still because that anchor-line still hasn’t given him any slack. *It’s still coming*. Delayed, even? His phone is still in his hand. The screen goes black as he glances at it. He wakes it up. Goes to his texts. Him noting to Dad that they were out of pickles and Dad being a Dad about it, typing out “thumbs up emoji” just to try to get a rise out of him. Mark trying to get him a job. Lila’s one-word response to a rant he’d sent her about how a book ended.

Finally, he finds the angle his brain will let him start from. “What was the point of that? Playing chicken with an angel, dragging me right up to a Big Knife and then saying 'never mind?'”

Mustang pauses (maybe put off by an idiom that didn’t translate) and slowly lowers his hand before saying, “How much did you hear of what Mere and I said to each other?”

“She just said that you guys might have gotten off-course. But you were so close. How do you know you haven’t missed our chance?”

“We spoke while you answered,” Mustang said. He said it like he was choosing his words. Counting them. And somehow, David believed him. “You didn’t hear me challenge her near the End, but you heard me in the tower. I was reckless the first time I tried to be rid of Thrast, and I cut my own heart out instead. I shan’t repeat that mistake.”

“But it’s gonna mean me dead, isn’t it?” David asked. “One way or another?”

“We do not know that.”

“But probably.”

Mustang asks, “Is that what you want?”

David feels the sensation of the angel studying him again. Feels the burning, the buzzing like static, feels his mind turning away to something else.

“So what’s up with that broken gate?”

Mustang regards it. His hand drifts to his side.

He says, “It is a Marshall’s Gate. A relic. I suppose it was easier for Mere to send us through here, but I had not thought it possible to come and go from Veneth herself by such a gate.”

“How is that still hanging there?”

“The stone is crumbling, but some Associations must be holding it together.” Mustang takes one step closer, eyes scanning the structure, and then gestures them both back. “These gates are more dangerous than I knew. There is no telling where it might send you if you crossed that threshold now. Across realms? Into the harrowing Wilds? Mere has kept her peace about them for too long.”

“You’re saying that she was lying about them?”

“She rarely reveals knowledge from the days before her homeland became a desolation.”

David opens a notes app and swipes in some key words to remember. *Veneth. Marshall’s Gate. Mere’s desolate homeland. **Thrast.*** He says, “You called the Gate a relic. How long ago are we placing that desolation?”

“Centuries ago,” Mustang says.

“So Mere is, like, closer to 500 years old than to 40?”

“I don't know. Lenn and Mere say that different realms treat the passage of time differently, especially liminal ones like the Bridge. Mere mentioned something of this as we approached the End.”

David adds *Time is unreliable* to his notes.

Mustang watches him swipe. “You are fond of this miniature slate?”

“Helps to write some things down,” David says, “When I can’t keep it straight in my head.”

“A writing surface, a link to the voices of your loved ones, and a record-taker. Seems a useful tool.”

“Shame it took applying generations of accumulated scientific discovery and a system chaining millions of people to the profit motive to achieve it. And what does it get me now? I can’t call my sister back across the multiverse. Just take some videos no one else will ever see and some notes. I’m not even sure how it’s still working. It’s supposed to connect to a giant network of similar machines using invisible light waves back on Earth. There’s none of that here. And it’s supposed to be powered by a battery, a little tool inside the machine that stores power as chemical energy and doles it out to do all the neat little gimmicks. See here? There should be a display telling me how much power is left, but it’s just gone.”

Mustang plays along enough to peer at David’s screen, but slowly shakes his head. “I did not think this is what would get you talking.”

“Nervous habit,” David mutters. “And it’s bugging me.”

Mustang gives a pointed look that makes David hesitate instead of continuing. He says, “Count your words. That is not what bothers you.”

“Count my what?” David shakes his phone. “It worked before. Not for long. Something about going to the Bridge broke it. But I stayed on the call with Lila when I first appeared. Why is that?”

“Count your words, David Adamson.” Mustang, for some reason, gestured towards the storm. “Here on Veneth, and elsewhere where reality flows according to the Paradigms, truth resonates when spoken or sought with five words. It can be circumvented, yes. Even abused. But as a principle, you should note when your words betray a need to veil the truth. That alone can be revealing.

“You have Associated that object,” Mustang continues. “Whatever it was before, it is now also an object that reflects, or even bears, a piece of your soul. It is part of you.”

“How do you know that?”

“I am aligned with Association. I can read Associations easier than others, can manifest my will as an aura in ways that can shift the world. You may be on the road to such an alignment as well, given what you say happened with your device.”

“But still, how can you tell specifically that I’ve turned my phone into a magic item?”

“Two things,” Mustang says. “The first is that the ‘phone’ bears a little of your same aura. It’s faint, but clear enough for me to read. Second, it and the buds you put in your ears share a disturbing property with you.”

“A disturbing property,” David says.

“You are warded.” Mustang stares out at the storm in the distance. “A barrier of Separation--one of the strongest I have encountered--is shielding you from harm.”

“Is that why it felt like my shoulder was digging into your fingers, and not the other way around?”

“Not my only evidence, but yes.”

David asks, “Does it mean something to you?”

“It could mean many things,” Mustang says. “But my concern is that it means more than just the curse of banishing is affecting you.”

More notes in David’s phone: *I’m warded. Curse of Banishing. Association. Paradigms. Separation.*

“I don’t want you dead,” Mustang says. Five words, like he’d said. Stupid that that should make it feel more true. But it did.

“Thanks,” David answered.

“Come. It’s not safe to remain.”

“Shouldn’t we wait for Mere?”

“Mere will find us when it is time. Until then, we should find somewhere to shelter.”
