| Lila |
| :---: |

Lila has returned to the Adamson house from the city many times, whether from shopping and hanging out with friends in the latter days of high school or visiting the family on holidays and weekends throughout most of her undergrad. The landscape of rural southwest Michigan is peppered with modern ruins: abandoned barns and crumbling homes that are neighbors to the bespoke and newly constructed with brand new pickup trucks in their driveways. Time and vegetation will slowly drag evidence of human neglect beneath the soil. This has been the state of the world as she sees it. It is a system where entropy’s promised end is being helped along by greed and self-possession. But now, apparently, it’s worse than that. Because now, apparently, there’s a monster in her family’s home.

Screaming down the road at the pace of the hurlant rhapsody of guitar riffs and dark crashes playing from her speakers doesn’t deflect or soften the blows these vistas strike, though. They hit her just as hard and they hit her faster. She doesn’t shed tears on the drive, but by the time she reaches her parents’ driveway her knuckles are aching.

Lila tries calling David four more times on the way. Every time she calls the automated voice says that his number is unavailable. Each time she feels a twinge of dread between her lower ribs and then a further, fuzzier answering pang like the toll of a distant bell or a tug on a thread. Something has gone sour with reality, she thinks, but her last thought as she tears to a stop and tumbles out of her car is that there might also be something off with *her*.

The house is quiet from the outside, but it’s big and well-insulated, so even if something is happening inside she might not be able to hear unless she gets closer. She hesitates when she notices the quiet. It’s a chance, just a breath, to try to gather herself and to see if she can spot anything amiss on the property. In that hanging moment, part of her hopes she’ll see David come running through that door, that it’s all some strange prank he pulled on her. Even for just a moment, the thought that her parents might be the ones to show up appeals to her too. But the house is still, looming over her like a calm adult assessing the panicked breathing of a child underfoot.

She considers her approach. She could drift into the yard between the two embattled maples to peer through the kitchen window, but that would give her away. If she slips in through the garage she can collect some improvised weapons on the way in. Or there’s the window in the back that she can climb through.

It would make the decision easier to know what she should take “he will unmake you” to mean.  The warning the grim stranger gave on David’s call was unsurprisingly dire, but also the word used to describe what she would find here was “man.” The thing about men that are monsters is that they are still flesh and blood. All flesh unmakes easily enough.

Lila settles on snatching up a pair of pruning shears and her dad’s driver out of the garage and heading to the back. There’s a little low shed right behind the house, close enough that she easily hauls herself and her weapons onto its roof and from there grasps the sill of her brother’s window. David doesn’t keep it locked; he likes having an out.

It catches her off guard to be disappointed that David’s room is empty. The blankets are thrown back near the foot of his bed, and the sheets are laden with two open notebooks, a bookmarked novel, and his laptop, which is open and displaying the question, “Are you still watching?” Clothes litter the floor. His typical mess. The neatest part of his room is the short bookshelf in the corner. He’s squeezed as much space as he can out of the shelf, ordering novels by author and series, with fantasy taking up most of the territory. Last year’s copy of The Great American Short Story is sitting on top. It has three more bookmarks tagging certain stories within. David’s white door is closed as always.

As Lila takes this in she hears a quiet sucking sound coming from what she thinks is the kitchen. At first hearing it only makes her freeze. But as she listens closer, the sounds of wet toil flip her guts like an omelette. Goosebumps roll down her arms. She grips the driver in both hands, then waits. The source of the sound doesn’t seem to be coming closer.

She tries to re-center.

The corner of an empty picture frame peeks out from behind David’s dresser. It’s the one she gave him a couple birthdays ago along with a print of one of the sloppiest and most endearing pictures of Giddy she could find. He was supposed to put it up in his room and look at it to remember the love that one good dog had given them all. There’s no print to be seen. Just the dark frame. Is that a crack in the glass?

He keeps claiming there’s nothing wrong. He said it was stupid. That he’s somewhere else already.

A flush of heat drives her out into the hall.

Once the door opens, the crash of glass jars and thunks of boxes run together with stretching rubber and starch-thickened water circling a drain. Sulfur in the nose. Salt on the tongue. It's coming from the kitchen, just a few steps down the hall. She approaches driver-first.

There she finds the contents of the kitchen rearranging themselves into the shape of a man. In nature flesh forms itself with decorum: the resources a being gathers are tucked behind a veil, worked on behind the scenes until the fruits of that labor are ready to be presented. This… isn’t that–-this isn’t flesh yet. It’s not a man yet. Water from the running faucet falls into an eddy of rapidly corporating material; eggs boiling together with pop-tarts, a pork-chop, leftover stir fry vegetables still partially in their container, and a tub of ice cream are all still barely recognizable amidst cording musculature, calcifying bone, and congealing soft tissues.

As Lila stumbles upon someone flaying himself *into being* in her parents’ kitchen, she feels the transgression like a knife in her chest. There’s a weight to the presence she has just entered. When she steps into the room, the would-be flesh mass shifts. It has only formed a shape of something that resembles a head yet, but that elliptical orb filled with olives and jewelry turns slightly, and *his attention* settles on her.

Lila yelps. Her joints lock in place.

*Ah*, a voice that is not her own interjects into her thoughts. He sounds as if he has found the line he was thumbing for in a book. The interjection is accompanied by another punch of that knife in her chest. She feels the heat of it, tries to look down but only her eyes move, and just long enough to see that there’s no actual wound.

The voice says, *I had wondered if minds here would be as pliant*. His tone is, again, conversational, but it buzzes like an intrusive thought, demanding her attention and creasing her forehead. *Do please try to suppress your alarm. I shall be as gentle as I can, but you should know that those weapons are to no avail.*

Her body will not move. It won’t respond to her at all. She aches to take a breath that won’t come. Her eyes burn. Her diaphragm tries to lurch, halts, cramps. Meanwhile the shape coheres in front of her, though her vision swims and flickers.

Moments of blessed silence. Thoughts flare and race through her mind like a meteor across a night sky. She can’t track them, can’t keep hold of them, except that it’s *him*. He is doing this to her. Casually! Carelessly! The silence is snatched away.

*You must understand my caution. You are not one of those who destroyed my body and cast me out, yet report of it echoes in your thoughts. How could that have been? My first discovery was that this place has somehow laid dormant to the Paradigms for all of its history, until some errant thread tied me to that other.*

*Your brother, it seems? And by some fluke he passed on just enough to warn you of my coming. Now here you are, ready to brain me for a home-invading thug. Oh, Lila Adamson, my spectacularly helpless creature. I see it nascent in you. That glint in your eyes. You will bind yourself to these affairs. You will mire yourself in the wet clay of this world as I remake it.*

He releases her breath, which comes to her in coughing gasps that rattle in her throat.

In the time that has passed, he has managed to approximate enough organs to enable speech, because the next words come from his mouth and not within her own mind.

“So many questions you’re drowning under that formless rage,” he says. “It is best to let these things go. There is work to be done.” A sort of eye has forms, briefly, from a piece of amber shaped to appear as a star. He uses this to eye her appraisingly.

Lila’s breathing has grated into a wordless growl. All he will allow.

He says, “Yet it seems it is the nature of the yoked to buck against the man who drives the plow.”

Because her jaw is locked half-open, she screams in her head, *We are not livestock*!

“And I do not preside over beasts. Lila, your mind quivers. Your will howls itself ragged in the valley of your impotence. It will not remain this way. You will learn to serve your purpose without complaint. But you have limits, and those force me to relent. You will be of less use to me dead. So I must see for myself the state of my newest inheritance if I am to rectify its faults and prevent the Ruin you would bring it to.”

Drifting above the linoleum with feet that are still forming, he passes by Lila with an effortless indifference. The front door of the Adamson house opens unbidden for him. He makes a show of turning again. The star-eye has been replaced by one much more organic, but also bloodshot. He says, “Stay.”

Then he is gone.

He left the faucet running.

Hyperventilating. Mental static. A thunderstorm heartbeat in a body pinned into place. Lila screams. She can see nothing. She can hear nothing but her own shredding voice. A tiny silver thread whispers, “You’re in shock.” And an amber one, filled with the calm of resignation, tries to tell her to be relieved that he’ll be coming back to turn the faucet off.

It’s still there, that initial transgression from meeting him. That was all it took to give her *this*. One abrupt introduction to a new reality. He seized control of her in that moment of realization, using a power from beyond Earth. What did he say? “Dormant to the Paradigms?” But it’s not sleeping anymore. Magic unfurls itself in Lila like the blossoming fire of a wound to the chest, and the magic is the irreducible assignation of meaning.

This is Association.

She doesn’t belong to Thrast. She is her own, but to reclaim the use of her own body against what he imposed on her, she needs more than just the Association kindled in her heart. It took Thrast more than just that to assert himself over her. It took reaching out. She can feel it, like taut threads reaching straight through the walls of the Adamson house towards where Thrast went. It’s within her, too, in the way she counts the seconds since he left, and countless lines of thought streaming across the night sky of her mind trying to plan or reason or dream her way out of this trap. Magic unfurls itself in her like the blossoming fire of a wound to the chest, and it is the scroll-the-job-listings, nervous-cover-letter glance you steal before you take a dive.

This is Extension.

With it Lila reaches through the extent of her own body, and iron laces her nerves and joints. This one has always been there waiting for her, the constant self-declarative “Mine,” the possessive shriek that tore from her voice when her own self-authority was undermined. It’s been surging toward the surface, looking for the touch of intent and meaning to release it. Magic unfurls itself in her like the blossoming fire of a wound to the chest, and it is ownership, even of pain.

This is Domination.

Lila unlocks her self. She staggers over to the sink, with that water still running, and deposits the contents of her stomach down the drain. She allows herself precious time to be wracked with sobbing, to scream and swear and curl into a ball. Then she rolls back to her feet, aching, and turns it all to cold fury. Thrast has been gone for no more than two minutes.

Lila leaves the faucet running. She bursts out the still-open front door and sprints to her car in the driveway.

Her suitcase in the trunk has enough clothes for a weekend of unpredictable Michigan weather, including a navy-colored scarf she knitted for herself and her favorite jacket, once a deep and dark red but faded from years of constant use. She wraps the scarf around her neck, despite how hot her chest feels, but doesn’t put that jacket on yet.

Her body is still screaming in pain, covered over in cramps from being locked in place. When you’ve chosen a path--when you’ve started down it, the travel itself wears you down. You rest, you eat, you turn that time and energy into new strength. You use every breath to displace the exhaustion of your cells and bolster them in defiance of entropy. And when you decide you’re going to take your fragile little body to the moon, you build yourself a damn rocket. Magic unfurls itself in Lila like the blossoming fire of a wound to the chest, and it’s the closing of the wound.

This is Edification.

Lila looks to the sky, where the taut threads of Thrast’s Extension still point her. He won’t be gone long. He left the faucet running, and it’s possible he may have noticed at this point. Her window is vanishingly small. She doesn’t have time to question herself. Sometimes you just have to commit to closing a door. Magic unfurls itself in Lila like the blossoming fire of a wound to the chest, and it is the parting both of the teeth from the flesh and the flesh from itself.

This is Separation.

With these Paradigms, especially with this last one, she can find a loose thread in Thrast and unravel him before he can do more of what he just did to her to the world. But first, to hijack the power of a tyrant.

Lila makes her own threads of Extension, reaching out to four objects and into herself. She climbs into the driver’s seat of her car. Her chosen vessels Associate to her the way a loved one is wakened by a soft touch. They become a part of her.

There are five.

Into the Oakley ring, which has passed through four generations of her family, she pours her Spirit, the essence of her emotions and connections with the world around her. A garnet, sardonyx, sapphire, and amethyst form the petals of a flower around an empty setting. The unending storm of experiences remembered, interpreted, and expected resides within Association, and through it she will assign meaning to the things she experiences. As Lila pushes her Association into the ring the empty setting is filled with a gleaming mote of fire.

And her Mind, a scramble of thought and parsed information projected into the intent of action, shunts into a smartphone wreathed in a black leather case. It is an ancillary to each other vessel: it’s not the judge but the paralegal; it is the axle not the steering wheel; it’s the statue in the mind of the sculptor; it is that which takes the measure of a divide. With her mind, she directs (but does not control) every part of herself, and from within a device that has a transceiver she can Extend herself to probe the whole of the world, if need be. While her mind’s new casing does not visibly change, its programming is irretrievably rewritten.

Her body retains her Domination. Her will, which her ring generates and her phone conducts, shall be executed by her body. Lila takes a breath. She releases it.

Into her scarf she places the stuff of her vitality, the impulse of genesis present in all cells that still divide. Edification will drive her to rebuild herself and raise up both substance and structure in the world around her. Her other vessels are vectors, but Vita will be her source and her destination. She wears the scarf as the mantle of her chosen duty, to live and to support life. Its hem un-knits itself and the threads start to weave into her hair and through her shirt.

Her jacket becomes the Edge of her being, a Separation between what is Lila and what is not. It is the most essential of tools: a knife, shield, hatchet, or veil as she requires. It sits around her shoulders and takes on a strangely heavy weight.

For a moment she lingers like this, her existence divvied between five objects but still whole. The vessels carry a tension. If she releases the pressure she will bounce back into herself. It will not last on its own. There has to be a line drawn she cannot cross again. The part of her that would hesitate, that would dwell on this snap decision and weigh its ramifications, is caught up still counting seconds till Thrast’s likely return. If she is caught in the midst, she will never get the chance again. If she fails to seize this opportunity now, while Thrast is still getting his bearings, no one on Earth will be safe from his will. So she acts.

Shifting, she slides her arms through the sleeves of her jacket and shimmies it on. A symbolic gesture, Associated instinctively with the act it accompanies: tying off each of the five vessels from the others, and snipping their connections.

Her ring flares. Her phone chirps. Her body stiffens. Her thread crawls down her arms. Then her breath escapes her lungs and her hand drops to the seat of the car, where skin and upholstery simultaneously ignite.

| Thrast |
| :---: |

Thrast ascends past a commingled canopy and into the open air. From the Lower Sky he looks out at the landscape nearby. There are many buildings, built to stand apart from each other, each with their own small field of tailored grass and even smaller aesthetic gardens. Some even have fences erected between their own plots. But each house is also connected to the others, not just by roadways but by wires that hang from poles and lattice whole communities.

He climbs higher, into the Upper Sky, and spreads his Extension farther. The tang he first sensed in the air is a corruption. It is unseasonably hot. In the distance, there are smoke-clouds in the sky from the fires of industry. Each adult seems to have a personal carriage that functions by burning a particularly flammable elixir. In one place he spots a tremendous set of rolling hills of detritus, of scrap metal and the strange substance Lila named in her mind as plastic. Fields of waste, uncared for. He finds a city of great towers mid-construction. It is swarming with people. Those that do not suffer outwardly seem to have glaring holes in their souls. They stuff this full of whatever is at hand.

“Is this what we do to ourselves,” Thrast asks himself as he hangs in the Upper Sky, “wherever we are?” As with the people of Veneth, the tide of their mistakes is coming in and they are not watching the horizon. The wind sighs around Thrast, a long deep bellow of resignation from deeply-buried hopes. “Nor will I allow this candle to snuff itself.”

He returns to the girl.
