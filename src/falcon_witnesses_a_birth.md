# The Falcon Witnesses a Birth

Gist, the capitol of Naris, was the city of orchards and the seat of the gods. The city itself did not have high walls or gates, but it sported several palaces, the finest of which rose like a navel from the lowest point of the city. In the center of that palace, framed by copses of trees cultivated for the vibrant colors of their blossoms and the sweetness of their fruit, was the courtyard called the Forum of the Gods. It is there that the leaders of Naris, the gods-officiant masked in the likeness of the creatures that represented their Sacred Deeds, met to execute matters of state and discuss the prognosticated fates of their nation. The public was forbidden to set foot inside.

The orphan girl called Mere never intended to enter the Forum of the Gods. Let alone that it was forbidden, in her scraped-together life on the outskirts of Gist she scarcely knew such a place existed. She knew little more than where she planned to get her next meal, until one day she slipped while climbing a tree in an orchard near the city’s edge to steal a fruit. When she landed, it was not into the brush under the eye of an angry arborist but onto gold-and-marble flagstones in plain view of all the gods.

This was, Mere would come to learn, interpreted as some kind of portent. It was never clear if the portent regarded her own fate or that of Naris. At the word of the Wolf God of Names and the Butterfly God of Dreams, Mere stood before the judgment of the gods and ate the fruit she’d plucked from the tree, sharing one bite with the god who was chosen to shepherd her from then forward: the Falcon God of Messengers.

There were some truly momentous things the gods chose not to tell Mere when she became the Sparrow to the Falcon. The gods of Naris saw much that they could not believe, understand, or countenance. By the time she learned of this withholding, Mere was past the point of blaming the long dead.

Before the Second and Final Razing of Naris, the Gods-officiant of the Sacred Deeds did not retain the names they bore prior to taking on their new countenances. Because of this Mere never learned the name of her master and predecessor, and she only once saw his face. He was known only by his titles or their variations: the King-errant, Falcon of Naris, God of Messengers. In public she referred to him in those terms or as “this one” or “that one.” In private she had called him Da.

The first thing he taught her was that “Veneth is not the only world there is, but it is ours, and that makes it precious.” He taught her, as well, that “Veneth blesses the connections made in the hearts of her people. The more these connections, these Associations, are shared in belief among peoples, the stronger and more blessed those Associations become.

“I am the God of Messengers because the people of Naris will for there to be such a god, for that god to be represented by a Whitecrest falcon, and expect for the Falcon to serve after the fashion I do. It is such for all of Naris’s gods, and it is such with other nations’ peoples and the things they hold in their hearts.

“It is our privelege and our duty to fulfill these stations for the edification of all life on Veneth.”

On the surface the Falcon’s duties were simple. He was to carry messages and parcels of all kinds across the face of Veneth. But his duty was also to champion and bolster any who sought to serve in the same way regardless of their national allegiance or station in life. As the inhabitant of a position that embodied these ideas, his responsibility to convey urgent messages across great distances with all surety and speed required him to utilize paths that skirted the natural bounds of Veneth.

As his Sparrow, Mere bore witness and learned what was needed for her to take up his godhood when he could no longer inhabit it, and she cherished the work. Yes, she attended to his lessons about the Paradigms, and how one aligns with them. She could dutifully recite them back, and make skillful enough demonstrations of that sacred knowledge. But from the first time the Falcon took the Gilded Sword to a hillside and carved out a door that led them *outside of Veneth*, Mere was enraptured. This, she thought, was the secret uttermost glory of their nation. In the face of the power to walk the roads between realities, what use were other Deeds like the duplication of self or the quieting of the dead?

The years turned the child Sparrow into a young woman. And if over those Mere was not always attentive to the man behind the Falcon’s mask, unable to read the face he never exposed to the world, could she really be blamed? She was grateful. She was dutiful. She was brilliant. But she was never permitted to return to the forum she somehow fell into as a child.

When the Falcon came out of one such meeting seeming, perhaps, more haunted and bemused than usual, she thought it likely only the difficulty of politics. She knew that many of the gods desired war and dominion where the Falcon sought service and mutual good. But he would not speak to her while he woke of what he learned from the Butterfly God of Dreams that day, or of the reminders of the things they would not disclose when they bound her as his Sparrow, or of the command he was given that he knew he could not obey. But he would sleep, and sometimes his mutterings would betray whispers of his misgivings to her ears. Despite all the ready answers and mindful care she might give herself in later years, her memories always tried to heft the weight of regret onto her shoulders for not acting on those misgivings.

A month after the Falcon received his troubling instruction, he broke up their routine because, as he claimed, word had reached him that the Marshall’s Gate at the edge of the Unkept Wilds was in a state of disrepair. And of course, of all the gates to let fall into disuse, they could not afford to let that one lapse.

As part of the services Naris provided to the rest of Veneth through their God of Messengers the Falcon maintained a set of Gates in certain key locations. Through these Gates the lay people could pass bearing messages, goods, or arms across great distances in the space of a breath. It was essential for the safety of the people (and the goodwill given Naris by the nations that made use of them) that the Gates not malfunction.

One of those Gates had been founded on the border of the Wilds many generations ago for two reasons. The first was that the Wilds were untethered from Place. They roamed or blinked across the continents of Veneth without noticeable pattern. Any nation could find itself a neighbor to the Wilds without warning, and it could last for the span of a day or a decade. The second reason for the Wilds’ Gate was that sometimes the Wilds poured forth a dangerous host, be they beasts or phantom forces, and the nations of Veneth needed to be able to field armies to respond in the span of hours or days to protect each other from that standing threat.

Though the Unkept Wilds themselves defy a sense of place, dozens of lesser Places mark the frontiers of the unmappable, vagrant territory. These border markers adhere to the forms of wells, shelters, and temples which arrive and vanish as apparitions near the real or imagined borders of nations and biomes. These are gathering places for those stricken by experiences in the Wilds. They are also vessels to accumulate the myriad collective Associations that hold the Wilds in a forcibly nebulous state of conceptual wilderness. One such temple usually happened to be near the Wilds’ Gate.

The Temple of Answered Questions prefers to manifest in mountain passes, carved into one ancient cliff face or another, noticeable first by the red brick path that leads up to it. At first this path is haphazard: a brick appears packed into the soil on its lonesome, then a pair, until slowly whatever stone or dirt made up the path before is replaced by a neatly-paved and eventually lacquered little road to the temple’s open-arched entryway. It is onto the point where that path transitions into glistening, muted grandeur that the Falcon and his Sparrow emerged.

“Sparrow,” he said to Mere, and pointed to a branch in the path that was paved with stones uniformly covered in healthy patches of moss, “that path leads to the Marshall’s Gate. Assess its condition. Repair it if you feel it within your abilities. I will be in the temple. There is a message I must deliver this day.”

Proud to be trusted with the task on her own, and trusting in turn of her master’s intentions, she parted with him there and traveled the path to the Marshall’s Gate. The path wound through a small mountain pass and out onto a plateau broad enough for a company of soldiers in closed ranks. The Gate itself was carved into the mountainside, a tall arch whose base had a banded appearance that might have been painted once long ago. As with all of the Marshall’s Gates, this one’s centerpiece was a stone with a relief in the shape of a sword held vertically with the blade down, as if hanging over the heads of those who would pass through the Gate. A warning, the Falcon had called it. Or a promise.

Some inspection revealed to Mere that the physical arch of the Gate was undamaged. If there was something wrong with the Gate, it was a matter of its Associations. Mere preferred it that way. She was, she must admit, a poor hand at masonry.

The trouble, she determined, was a fairly common one for Gates. Over time, as the Gate was either used or neglected, the local beliefs about the Gate would begin to skew, and this misaligned the careful connection between that Gate and the others in its route. The quickest solution was a matter of discerning which Gates were meant to be on the same route as this Gate, and making a few quick trips along that route to realign the Associations.

She could probably do it herself, but she realized that this particular Marshall’s Gate was routed with *all of the other active Gates*. Any nation needed to be able to muster to the Wilds, after all. Yet, Mere wondered, what if something or someone emerged from the Wilds who understood the Gates and their routes instinctively? Couldn’t they use this Gate to then launch an attack on any nation on Veneth?

Between the time it would take to pass through every single Gate in a way that would appropriately reinforce this Gate’s Associations and her sudden uncertainty about the wisdom of this Gate’s existence, Mere decided it was better to bring her assessment to the Falcon than to try to handle it herself. So back up through the pass she went, a pleasant stroll on a pleasant afternoon, until she heard the screaming. Then, of course, Mere ran.

In the Temple of Answered Questions, under the care and ministrations of the God of Messengers, a woman was giving birth. There was only one other person there, a priest of the temple whose demeanor felt out of place to any nation Mere had visited with the Falcon. Together, Mere and the two men saw to the woman’s needs as best they could. The labor was agony for the woman. It was enough to convince Mere that she had no interest in going through such an ordeal for herself.

But as the labor wore on, the tenor of the situation changed. A fervor came over the priest and the mother. The cries of pain and effort turned to ones of rapture. And the Falcon? Who could read his face beneath that mask? It seemed his eyes were like that of a raptor’s: piercing, impassive. Even as he worked to aid the mother, his manner became terse.

Eventually, even Mere felt it coming, like the temple itself groaned with the pangs of this childbirth. The sky darkened, turning her attention away from the labor. Mere moved to the entrance of the temple to watch Heaven split itself with lightnings. In the midst of the birth, the Wilds grew restless, pacing across the face of Veneth like a father too unnerved to provide support for the arrival of the thing he has helped to create. Mere saw vistas of Kolomaer, Qastra, and Naris pass by to the rhythm of the mother pushing. She saw lands even the Falcon had not delivered a message to in living memory. And her own organs felt like they were twisting inside her, trying to turn her attention on the impending birth like her body was a plant seeking the sun.

She feared to turn and bear witness, then, until the Falcon placed a hand on her shoulder.

“Is this why we came?” she asked.

Before the Falcon answered, Veneth did. The Wilds perched the Temple on a fjord overlooking the interminable storm on the Sea of Goletha just in time for an enormous thunderswell to drive them bodily back from the temple entrance. When the roaring of the thunder died, they could hear the baby crying.

The Falcon turned, and as if the words were ripped from his mouth, declared, “Behold! A child is born tonight in the hall of answers! He will tame the waters of Goletha. He will marshall all Veneth to his name. He will bear witness to the coming ruin. Rejoice, for his aim is peace! Weep, for he clothes himself in glory! Behold, Thrast! The gods welcome you!”

And Mere, watching this declaration with the storm now raging in her stomach, stared at the Falcon’s trembling hand that held the Gilded Sword. His grip was always so sure and steady. Not now. There was a slow, incredulous plunge, punctuated by the tiny cries of that little child placed on his mother’s breast, as the Falcon approached with all the grace and doom of a swooping bird of prey. Mere watched, frozen, until at long last her master reached out and cut the cord that tied Thrast to his mother’s womb with a sword that could carve doorways between realms.

Then the Falcon staggered out past Mere into the stormwinds.
