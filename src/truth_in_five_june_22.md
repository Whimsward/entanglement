# Truth in Five Words Eminent

But I’ve digressed from the scene in progress, where David stops in his tracks at the sight of a flaming Sword the size of a building plunged into the stonework of the Bridge. If the Bridge were an actual physical object in a place where physicality was properly embodied and given expression by the Paradigms, then the Bridge’s relationship to the Sword would need to be communicated with details we can grasp, like the apparent relevant ages of the stone and the steel and a webbing of cracks that communicate the effects of the passage of time on both. But while this realm is old and the Sword is older still, there is no sign of weathering. The Sword’s apparent position in the Bridge is only a signpost of the effect the Sword has had on the Bridge. The Sword is not even bound to this realm.
David doesn’t realize any of this. He can’t see past the Sword, but he can almost see a figure of light, postured like it’s holding the sword in place. When he freezes, he feels the figure’s attention fall on him, feels that central tether strain against his imagined mass, feels Mustang clap his second hand on David’s other shoulder like the officer is catching David as he loses his balance. Maybe he is.
 “Who approaches me?” An odd stray thought passes through David’s mind on encountering the angel’s voice: why would someone with a voice so imperious, so commanding, resort to the vulnerability of asking a question?
Mere and Mustang are conspicuously, agonizingly silent.
David answers, “It’s David.”
“Why has David Huxley Adamson come to stand before my vigil?”
Startled to be put on the spot, David looks wildly to the people who brought him here. He can’t make anything out on their faces. Actually, in the glare of the angel’s light and flames of the sword, he can’t see their faces at all. Still, Mere just said that they’d arrive when the thought that carried them here finished. She also said…
“We’re here to talk to Lenn,” David says.
Persaval pulls David back a step. He does this because he feels a Separation (not his own) pulling David towards the Sword that Seals All Fates, and it is his first reaction, now, to spare a soul from being claimed by such a parting. [In part because he is guarded and in part because the exchange is not meant for him, he does not hear (or rather perceive) the questions of the angel or David’s answers1.] The light is not so blinding for Persaval. He looks to Mere, who is pointedly avoiding turning her gaze to the angel.
Mere says, “He is not here.”
Persaval has kept himself warded from the disappointment he knew would come in this moment, but it’s clear from Mere’s face that she was hoping to deliver a reunion, however brief.
If there is a hesitation to the angel’s next question, it is only natural. Though the being cannot truly be surprised, it can still feel, and there is a particularly jarring weight to David’s ignorance, and the exchange between those who brought him that he cannot perceive. Having measured that weight, the angel asks, “Do you know what lays beyond my vigil?”
David makes a fidgety gesture at the giant sword that’s on fire and emanating waves of biblical finality. He tries to say, “I’m gonna guess an Eden.” But, and it comes out “An End.”
He tries again, several times. “An end. An end? An end! An… end. An end…”
“Why do you fear death?”
