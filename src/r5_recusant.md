# Recusant

As Mere returns to Veneth from the Bridge again, she emerges this time into the sunset-washed High Hall of Kolomaer. Her passage is through a broad archway (another door, but always open), and as she comes through Mere notices a little clump of snow that has been clinging to her coat somehow even through two disembodied Realms. She snatches it loose between her fingers.

Anshall is a large man, prone to careful movements because of his size, and still he seems only to dangle from the throne of Kolomaer like a doll placed in a chair too large for any one person. Most of this affect is new. A weight drags down the Sovereign’s shoulders and quells any fire that might shine in his eyes. This man, who is surrounded by thirty-foot tall columns of gilded marble and who is attended by dozens of scribes, counselors, and adjutants, wears the countenance of someone waiting to die.

An aide startles, and, still unaware of Mere's abrupt arrival, she turns toward Anshall and declaims, “Announcing her grace Mere, the Falcon Goddess of Messengers, bearer of the Gilded Sword and wielder of the Iron Ring, broker of the peace of Harrows and counselor to the High Hall.”

Mere gives the aide a slight bow. “Thank you.”

“You are, of course, welcome in my court,” Anshall says. “But must you compel the members of my court to declare your arrival?”

Mere studies the clump of snow between her fingers. It insists on ignoring the heat of the Kolomaeri evening and maintaining the slight, crunchy give that lightly packed snow usually has. She says, “By your leave, is it not sacred custom in Kolomaer that visiting nobles, royals, and dignitaries be announced when entering the presence of the Sovereign or his representatives? To breach such a custom is considered a curse by your people, and I am who I am. It is Kolomaer that compels them to speak."

This does not seem to relieve the Sovereign or put his attendants at ease. Even here, in a place whose abundant prosperity is so clearly tied to the fortune of their nation's Associations, the folk can be so uncomfortable with the consequences of embracing the strictures of social tradition. Would that they might consider its consequences beyond the odd compulsion towards announcing a guest and into the risks of producing immutable State goods. Coins were one thing, but arms?

“I come bearing news meant for the Sovereign alone.”

Anshall nods to the members of his court. “I am happy to entertain a private audience.”

His court departs.

When they have gone, Mere says, “We are not yet finished.”

“I felt the Circle spring loose and then nothing more. Tell me, does he come for us already?”

Mere crosses the hall while he speaks until she stands before the high seat from which Anshall seems to dangle. She pinches the pellet of snow in her fingers. She says, “Thrast is not on Veneth. Instead, a boy has appeared whom we believe to be bound to our foe. He may be the key to making the curse permanent. The boy is to be guided along a path that will fulfill the intent of our curse on our foe.”

“Am I, then, to stamp the Sovereign of Kolomaer’s indelible seal on these proceedings?”

“Your support throughout our endeavor to free Veneth has been the foundation without which we could have accomplished nothing. Don’t doubt yourself, good Sovereign. There is no Circle without you.”

“Yet I sit on this throne, signing papers and sweating blood, while you tread your tireless and sacred path.”

Mere steps up beside him. “Do not get it confused. I’m but an errand runner. You’re the face of prosperity.”

Anshall says, “Surely you recall that his officers in the legion carry swords that bear the seal of Kolomaer?"

Mere says she does.

He continues, "‘Nothing that bears the seal of the Sovereign of Kolomaer shall pass away.’ My forebears armed him with Eternal Blades. I brokered treaties with him. And now that I have turned against him? He will kill me first.”

Her compulsion is to trace her thumb across the Iron Ring, but instead there is that stubborn tuft of snow. She pinches. It gives, but does not break. “If he returns, then yes. Once the Circle is rebound,we can send the Sworn Sword to your side.”

Anshall stares through her at that. There is something turning over on his face, which from the history of what he has let flow through the Circle's bond she thinks she can guess at. He is a creature of growth and building, a man aligned forcibly by his station with the Paradigm of Edification. Even before they enacted the curse he often strained against the bonds of that alignment, as if a position of prosperity and sovereignty would serve the same effect on him as a shackle. A man like Anshall is capable of fostering reality from virtually any given choice of action, but is also bound by duty to be certain that the choice he does make is the right one. And here in his High Hall, he gives under the weight of that duty.

"No," he says. “I do not think that will do me any good."

"What do you mean?" Is he refusing Persaval's protection? 

Anshall says, "I assume he is currently minding the boy."

"Yes."

"Let him continue. If what you say is true, he is more essential to our efforts than I."

Mere studies that tortured face. Is there a seed of a plan within that turmoil? If so, it's not one he seems willing to share with her.

She steps up beside him and asks, "Will you join your strength to the Circle again?"

He takes her extended hand, and the tenuous bond floods again with presence. She feels years of guilt and doubt break over herself and Kella and Lenn. She feels the response from the others: Kella's quiet and deep affection swallowing up the fathoms of Anshall's uncertainty, and Lenn's certainty and determination smoothing the bond back into equilibrium. Thus steadied, the connection that felt tenuous before now feels almost more substantial than the world around her. The Circle emboldened this way could be a girding around Veneth herself.

An aftershock of heady access to an amount of power she'd briefly lost sends a shudder through Mere, but she accepts this, observes it, absorbs it. She may not have Persaval's full alignment, but she knows how to distance herself from a moment.

She focuses on Anshall's face, where settles a small relief that some portion of him need not dwell in the weight that presses down on him. She keeps a hold of his hand.

"Please don't carry it yourself," she says. "That's not what the Circle is for."

When Anshall pulls his hand away, he is holding that little pellet of snow.

"What is this?" he asks.

She says, "Snow from Kella's mountain."

He cradles it more gently for knowing what it is.

Mere says, "It's more resilient than you might expect."

He says, not looking at it, "And growing."

Then he lowers himself from his throne and lumbers—he used to stride—towards the west, where the sunset spills through the open columns of his court. Mere is carried along by the line of his gaze, but she notes him rolling the tiny snow-ball gently in his fingers.

There is a low wall running between the outer columns of the Sovereign’s audience hall. Though it reaches scarcely to Mere’s chest and to the bottom of Anshall’s ribs, it serves to bar a plunge nearly thirty paces to the next outcropping down the cliff face. The wall is capped with a polished rail in a silvery metal which is stamped in measured increments with the Seal of the Sovereign. The presence of the seal forestalls any rust and even much of the dust that might mar its surface. That unblemished surface currently reflects burnished amber and scarlet light tinged with a blush of pink and lavender. To place a hand on the blazing rail, as they do now, looks almost like touching the sunset itself.

Anshall’s gaze is directed beyond and far below into the valley the Kolomaeri mountain overlooks. A massive bank of fog obscures, as it has for more than a century, a handful of broken stone shapes scattered through the valley.

"Did I tell you how it felt to meet you for the first time?" he asks.

She shakes her head.

"Now that I think of it, I had a warning first. A letter appeared one morning upon my desk. It was not sealed, and it simply said, ‘The Falcon returns to Veneth.’

“There was rumbling in my courts. I myself made much of it. One of the storied Gods of our neighbor and rival in antiquity was rumored to return, and it was the one with whom we’d shared the best rapport? The nation bubbled with questions of how and to what end, until you finally appeared.

“You were a wild woman. Dazed, it seemed at first. I know now it was layers of righteous fury. The only right course was to offer you the best hospitality the High Hall could afford you. And to heed your counsel, once you could give it.

“I was already wracked with guilt for leading my nation in impasse while the wizard wove his will through our political rivals and client states. When I heard that someone from the Hundred Halls persisted today, I dreaded your wrath.

“You did not bring wrath. You brought me truth instead. And from truths we once forsook or never knew I thought I saw a hope that we might set this right together. I have not forgotten that.”

All the while he rolls that pellet in his finger like a jewel. He does not look at it, but his fidgeting keeps drawing her eye. He’s rolled it smooth and round and tightly packed. It’s packed so tightly now, in fact, that the curved surface of the snow-ball catches some sheen off the evening radiance. Under his fingers it is no longer a clump of snow but a pearl of ice.

Anshall turns his gaze on Mere and says, “You ask us not to carry our weight alone. You’re right, of course. The things we bury have a tendency to grow on us.”

"What is it you're thinking?"

"I think I shall die. Now please, I know that our time is short. It is yours to run errands, and it is mine to wait. You have my support, now close the Circle and solve this."
